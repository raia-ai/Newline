Export Assembly Centers (EACs)



Newline’s EAC Software enables sheep exporters in Northern  Ireland  running
export assembly centers (EACs) to read electronically tagged  sheep  into  a
collection centre. Assign the sheep to batches if required  and  record  the
movement into the EAC and the movement off the EAC. Informing DARNI  of  the
movement(s).

To begin using the software double click the EAC Software icon.

2. Move Animals On To EAC allows a user to record the movement  date,  flock
number, MS2 document number, breed, age  and  sex.  The  user  should  enter
these details and then click the Enter Batch No button (if  you  know  where
these sheep will be going), or the Start Scanning button if  you  just  want
to scan them in without allocating them to a batch at the moment.  Once  the
start scanning button has been clicked, you will be asked if the blue  light
on the stick has been illuminated, if  it  is  continue,  if  not  you  must
investigate why the Bluetooth has not connected.  Use the EID stick to  read
the sheep eartags. Press the button briefly  within  a  few  inches  of  the
eartag. The light at the end of the stick should go green  if  the  read  is
successful. If it goes red the tag has already been read.

                                    [pic]

NB: You must complete the Movement date, it must correspond with the
license date, Flock Number of where the sheep came from (check the license)
and the MS2 Number – the license number.  It is critical that this detail
is entered as is on the license.

You can only scan one license at a time into the export centre.  You must
complete the license before you start on another.  When you have finished
scanning the animals you must then finish this form and start another form
entering the next license number details and begin scanning sheep into this
one.  You cannot mix sheep in different license numbers when scanning on
for the first time.  They can be mixed once the license has been completely
scanned into the centre.  This is done using Option 3.

NB-1.  You should not change any of the settings under Reader Settings or
Settings without consultation with Newline staff.

Before you start adding data to the centre you must click on the Enter
Batch Number button.  This will display the following menu:

                                    [pic]

If you want to add a new batch then click on New Batch.  The next available
batch number will be displayed on the right of the screen and you should
then enter a Description of the Batch e.g. Dawn Meats – Lambs.  If you are
happy with this click on save.

If you want to add sheep to an existing batch you can click on the batch
and it will be displayed completed in the right of the form. Click save and
you will then be back at the following menu:

                                    [pic]

You are now ready to start entering data into the Collection Centre.  This
can be done in three ways:

     a. By clicking Start Scanning.  This will scan EID tags directly into
        the form below the button and will increment the numbers in How
        Many Read.


     b. Download from Reader.  This option can be used to download the
        memory from the reader into the form creating the list
        automatically from the reader.  Currently this downloads all tags
        on the reader and does not break it into groups/batches.


     c. Enter Manual Tag.  This option should be use to enter a tag number
        of a sheep that does not have an EID tag or has lost its EID tag.
        It must be entered as it is on the tag.


We are now ready to start scanning.  To do so click on the Start Scanning
Button.  [pic]

Once clicked you will be presented with the following message:
                                    [pic]

You are now ready to read the tags.  Place the stick in the center of the
head and press the green button.  The stick will bleep and a green light
will appear at the end of the stick.  The counter on the stick will
increment by 1 and the data will start populating the screen below the
start scanning button.  The ‘How Many Read’ will also increment as the
sheep are read.  Once complete, click on the cross on the right of the form
and the data will be saved.

You can add to this batch at a later date as explained further on in this
manual.



[pic]Sheep lose tags and in some cases tags can be defective and not read.
If this happens you can enter the ear tag number manually – it has to be
exactly as it appears on the tag without any spaces.  For Example:

      UK024422000445

Tags are entered through an input form as per the screenshot below:

                                    [pic]

[pic]:  The third method downloads data from the stick readers memory into
the form populating the lower half of it as if it was coming in from the
scanning.  Click on the Download from Reader button and you will be
presented with the following screenshot – the blue light should illuminate
on the reader:

                                    [pic]

If you agree with the numbers then click on Yes.  If not clock on No and
start again.
If you click on yes the tags will populate the form as follows:

                                    [pic]

You will then be asked if you want to clear the reader.  If all of the tags
have come in and the numbers tally click yes.  This will clear the memory
of the reader.

                                    [pic]

NB:  If you do not clear the sticks memory the tags that have just been
downloaded will be downloaded again – this is especially important if you
have opened another collection as the system does not check for duplicates
in closed collections.

[pic]

This option can be used to allocate sheep not in batches or sheep  that  you
want to change batch numbers and that are already scanned onto the EAC  into
the batch ready for moving off the EAC.

[pic]

The user can double click the row in the grid to select a current batch  and
add more sheep to it. Or double click the new batch row  and  give  the  new
batch a description (normally the location they are being  sent)  and  click
the save button. There must be  a  batch  number  showing  before  the  save
button is clicked.

                                    [pic]

Once the batch is selected click the Start Scanning button.

[pic]

The user is asked to check that the blue light on the EID stick in on.  This
indicates that there is a live and working  blue  tooth  connection  between
the stick and laptop. If the user clicks the No  button  they  will  not  be
able to scan eartags and will see the following warning message.

                                    [pic]

If they click yes, begin to scan and see the grid details filled in.

                                    [pic]

[pic]

The animals can be viewed by batch. You see how many sheep you have  in  any
given batch. Or you can view all. There is also an  option  to  view  closed
collections.

                                    [pic]

Double click a batch to view the individual sheep that make up the batch.

                                    [pic]

These details can be printed out, or exported to a csv file (which  will  be
readable in Excel), or sent to Aphis by clicking the  File  menu  option  in
the top left of the screen.

                                    [pic]

Send Details to Aphis will allow the sheep to be recorded onto  Aphis.  This
option needs to be done before sheep leave the EAC.

                                    [pic]


[pic].  This option allows dead anials to be read or entered manually to
record them as Dead.  The function of recording is the same throughout but
a slightly different screen will be displayed.  We have shown a manual
input screen but the system works the same as the other inputs – you can
scan the tags also:
                                    [pic]

When viewed in menu option 4 you will see that they are recorded as DEAD
and that the original batch they were in will be the number of sheep less
that you recorded.
                                    [pic]

[pic]  Option 6 works similarly to Option 5.  This option should be used to
move animals off the collection centre that are no longer going to be
exported:  For Example – You want to keep the aniamls and put them into
your own flock.  When selected the following screen will be displayed:
                                    [pic]
The flock mark is the flock mark you are moving the animlas to.  The date
is the date you move them and this data will populate the movement license
and you can print copies as required:

                                    [pic]

When all sheep have gone from a collection and you want to close it, so  you
can start a new one, click the ok button.

                                    [pic]

[pic] When selected the following screenshot will be presented – this
option should not be used unless instructed to do so by Newline Staff:

This section should not be sued unless instructed to do so by Newline
staff.

Initial setup to link the EID stick to the EAC Software.

The EAC software works with a variety of readers.  The one currently being
used is the Shearwell stick.  It has already been setup and these settings
should not be changed unless instructed to do so by a member of Newline
staff.  The settings are accessed through the Move onto EAC main form and
they are displayed below.

                                    [pic]

Shearwell Stick Reader Menu Functions

Please follow the following instructions in order to erase the Eartag
numbers on a Shearwell stick that has memory enabled.

      •     Power on the stick by pressing the green button, but continue to
           hold your finger on the button. This will take you into the
           stick menu.
      •     On the stick display you will see the following screen messages.
      •     “Hold For Menu”
      •     “New Group?”
      •     “Erase All Tags?” At this point let go of the green button.
      •     You then get a screen asking “Are You Sure?”  It also says
           “Press To Erase” (with a countdown from 5).
      •     Within the 5 second countdown, press the green button to erase
all tags.

If you had continued holding the green button past the 5 second countdown
to erase the tags, the following screens appear;

      •     “Erase Last Grp?” If you let go of the green button at this
           point you again get the “Are You Sure?” “Press To Erase” (with a
           countdown from 5), again.
      •     “Rapid Read On?” or “Rapid Read Off?” Depending on whether rapid
           read is disabled or enabled.
      •     “Disable Memory?”
      •     “Cancel”

If you disable the memory you will get the following screens when you
switch on the stick and continue to hold the green button.

      •     “Hold For Menu”
      •     “Enable Memory?”
      •     “Rapid Read On?”
      •     “Cancel”

It is important to note however, if at any point you release the green
button you will activate or deactivate whatever command screen you happen
to be in at that point in time and you can begin scanning.

In order to safely exit the stick menu without making changes, keep the
green button pressed until the “Cancel” screen appears, then release the
green button!

If you release the button at the wrong time, then you need to power off the
stick and start the process again.
