EID RACE: USER GUIDE (TOUGBOOK – Wi-Fi - & Software)


GETTING CONNECTED:

Press the Power button (top right hand corner of  TOUGHBOOK)  the  TOUGHBOOK
will load to its desktop. The standard password is; 123456


   1. Turn on the TOUGHBOOK, once it has loaded to the  desktop  you  should
      see a message in the bottom right hand corner of  the  screen  showing
      the successful connection to the Wi-Fi access point (the name  of  the
      Wi-Fi as standard is EID).
   2. You can check the connection of the Wi-Fi by  pressing  APP  button  4
      (see appendix for image) this will show the TOUGHBOOK is connected  to
      the correct Wi-Fi network. See Appendix for further Wi-Fi details.
   3. You can reconnect the mapped drive  to  the  server  by  pressing  APP
      button 3. Only do this when you know the TOUGHBOOK is connected to the
      EID Wi-Fi network (see point 2).
   4. Turn on the RDIF stick. To do this press  and  let  go  of  the  green
      button on the shaft of the RFID stick.

GETTING STARTED:

   5. Press APP button 3 to load the sheep EID software.





Double click on the relevant section (on a TOUCH SCREEN, e.g.  TOUGHBOOK  or
large screen press the relevant section twice).

















As soon as a lot is sold in either the SALERING  software  or  ‘Full  Lot  &
Price Input’ it will dynamically appear in the above screen  under  Lot  No,
Heads, Buyer columns (see below).

Click on the ‘Select Lot’ button if you want to read the lot  with  an  RFID
reader or click on ‘Skip Lot’ if there are no RFID tags in the lot.

Start reading the TAGS in the Lot, note the system will tell  you  how  many
you have read and how many are expected.

To finish reading a Lot click on the Orange ‘End Lot’  button  (see  below).
The screen for the next lot will appear with the next lot ready to be read.

The system will also show an audit  of  lots  read,  please  note  it  shows
correct reads and those which have not read the number sold (see below).

GETTING IT RIGHT:

   6. The system will not allow you to read the same ear  tag  in  the  same
      lot. The RFID stick reader has a light on the end of it; it will flash
      GREEN when it reads a tag and RED when it reads the same tag again.

   7. THE SYSTEM WORKS ON THE PREMISE THAT THE  LOT  NUMBER  IN  THE  MARKET
      SYSTEM IS THE SAME AS THE PEN NUMBER IN  THE  EID  SYSTEM.  These  two
      identifiers must be the same for the system to work correctly!



GETTING CONFIGURED (If you need to):

   8.  To check the configuration of the RFID
      stick reader, click on ‘Reader Settings’ and
      then ‘Reader 1’. Set the relevant COM Port
      (only do this if you know which COM PORT
      you are using, if you are unsure  contact  NEWLINE  ASP).  Choose  the
      relevant RFID stick reader.

IN THE OFFICE:

From the sale day menu;
Option 7:

The following options are available:

Select Option Number 3. View EID Tags Read
[pic]
The PENS in BLUE indicate TAGS read in the EID sys-
tem, the total number does not tally with the market system  (or  stock  has
not been booked into the market system at this time).  If  stock  is  to  be
entered into the market system after the sheep TAGS have been read  go  into
the above option all the PENS should go green. Any PENS still blue  indicate
a discrepancy between what has been read in  the  yard  and  what  has  been
entered into the market system.

BUYERS EID PRINTOUTS:

From the sale day menu;
Option 17.  Buyers Invoices/Reports
Option 1.   Buyers Invoices/Lists

the appropriate printer
[pic]

When you produce an Invoice for the relevant customer the system  will  Auto
print the EAR TAG print out. To not print the EAR TAG print out  change  the
Y to an N under the column Auto Print EID Tags

[pic]

APPENDIX:


Charging & Power:

    • The TOUGHBOOK must be fully charged after each time it is used. It can
      be charged by being placed correctly in its docking  station  (docking
      station needs to be connected to mains power) or  by  the  PSU  (power
      supply unit) supplied with the TOUGHBOOK.

    • The RFID stick must be charged after each use. To do this unscrew  the
      red cap end of the handle, carefully remove the 4  x  AA  rechargeable
      batteries and place them in the mains powered charge. PLEASE NOTE: the
      lights of the charger will flash  (two  flashing  lights)  whilst  the
      batteries are charging.  The  RED  lights  will  go  static  once  the
      batteries are charged.














    • The Wi-Fi access point must always be left turned on. If it is  turned
      off the TOUGHBOOK will NOT connect the rest of the  system  and  ‘real
      time’ element of the system will be compromised.

What’s on the TOUGHBOOK:

There are four APP (application) buttons on  the  right  hand  side  of  the
TOUGHBOOK as you look at it. As a standard these will do the following;

   1. Load the BLUETOOTH connection software
   2. Load the Sheep EID software
   3. Map the network drive. (normally the z: drive)
   4. Load the Wi-Fi connection software

The TOUGHBOOK should also have a lot splitting tag attached to it  (normally
on the top right hand side of the unit).

System Parameters (how the elements of the system connect):


The RFID stick reader connects to the TOUGHBOOK via a BLUETOOTH  connection.
Theoretically this can link up to 100 meters. In  practice  in  a  livestock
yard circa 60 meters seems to be achievable.

The TOUGHBOOK connects to the main office via the Wi-Fi (industrial)  access
point (this will generally be on a wall or in the roofing of a shed).

The Wi-Fi access point connects back  to  the  market  server  in  the  main
office network via a cat5e network cable.

These individual elements make up one  real  time  system,  this  means  the
second a tag is read in the yard it is immediately stored in the  data  base
on the server.

Wi-Fi Notes:


It is important that users familiarize themselves with the range of the  Wi-
Fi network. The software will not work outside the range of  the  EID  Wi-Fi
network, unless the TOUGHBOOK is housed in a docking station  with  a  cat5e
network cable connecting it to the main network.

All other Wi-Fi networks should have the word EXCLUDED  by  them.  To  check
this, press APP button 4 and you’ll see a list  of  Wi-Fi  networks  in  the
vicinity. If in any doubt contact Newline.

A green Fan icon will appear in  the  system  tray  when  the  TOUGHBOOK  is
successfully connected to a Wi-Fi network. The number of green bars  on  the
fan is the signal strength, the more the number  of  bars  the  greater  the
signal.


-----------------------






PLEASE NOTE: The system sets the appropriate Baud Rate, Data Bits, Stop
Bits, Parity & Handshaking, the user DOES NOT need to change these.
Once the relevant stick has been selected please tick ‘Com Port active’
If you are intending on using this RFID stick reader. If this is not done
the Reader button at the top of the software will not appear.






Replace the batteries with the Green dot on the battery pack on the same
side as the green on/off button on the RFID stick.



The PENS in GREEN indicate the same number of TAGS read compared to the
number of sheep entered in that PEN in the market system.



Number 10: Auto Print EID Tags will default to Y for Yes.
When the invoice is produced the EID Tags document will print.
Set the Auto Print EID Tags to N – No if you do not want the EID to
automatically print out with the invoice.


In this example no EID TAGS have been read






In this example Lot 4 has an issue. The EID system  expected  one  head  but
none were read.


IMPORTANT NOTE: Sale must be open on the market system for the EID reading
to work!
