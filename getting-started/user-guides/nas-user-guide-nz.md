NAS USER GUIDE

1. Log in:

Log into NAS with the login provided to you by Ian Girvan. It should take the format

User Name: bsmith

Password: Z1

The User Name and Password are case sensitive so be careful here.

2. Program Update:

The program update and customer update functions that used to be separated in Porirua Login are now part of the NAS system so if your computer has programs to update it will automatically bring up a screen telling you that there are programs to update. It is strongly recommended that you update the computer every time you see this screen but if you are in a very big rush there is the option to continue without updating.

Once this program has updated you will move on to the main starting NAS Screen as seen below.

3. Customer Update:

From the Main NAS Screen seen above you use option

17. Remote Server Update

N.B. You can both type in 17 in to the select option box or you can click on the option with the mouse.

Then Select option

1 Update Customers From HQ

Wait for the program to run and you hit OK when it tells you that the update is complete.

4. Customer Search.

On this main NAS Screen you can access your customer search function.

Customer Search

This search is similar to your old 2. Customer Edit search in LAMS however if you access it from this screen you are not able to set up Temporary Customers as you are not currently in a sale.

N.B. Please note that the picture icon beside this option corresponds to a picture at the top of the screen. This icon at the top of the screen is the icon you will need to use while in the auction system to access your customer so please have a good look at it.

Once again you can access the customer search either by typing in number one or by clicking with the mouse on the line of text. You can also click with the mouse on the icon at the top of the screen mentioned before.

4a. Searching for customers

There are lots of options on how to search for customer but these are the main option.

Enter a surname followed by initials separated with a # (found above the number 3 on your keyboard) i.e. Smith#B

Enter a Farm Name i.e. Blackrock

Enter a farm name followed by the entity description separated by a space i.e Blackrock Farms

These Fields are no longer case sensitive, once you have entered the name you want to search for you can either press the Enter (Return) Key or you can use the mouse to left click on Search.

But sometimes as in the case with Smith there are still too many options of customers in the list. To refine your search criteria you can select

F2 Additional Search Options

Select this by either pressing F2 on the keyboard or using your mouse to select the button. Here you can enter more information to any of the other Fields. The address line can be a detailed as you like with either a street or a town name to help refine your search.

Once you have finished adding your extra information you can search for you customer by either hitting F5 on the keyboard or using the mouse to select search.

If there is only one client that matches your search criteria you will be taken straight to the Detials Screen. If not you will need to select the customer you want from the list shown to you by either typing in the corresponding Reference number or by using the mouse to double click on the clients name.

4b. Customer Details Screen

On the customer details screen you can see most of the clients details at a glance and edit them by clicking on the area you want to edit and overwriting it. If you want to see the clients Stock Agent however you need to use the mouse to click on the tab that reads Agent/Rep Details.

7.a Sundry Vendors

From this search function you can set up sundry vendors, to do this search for a client to bring up a list of potential names.

If none of these are the account that you are looking for, from the list screen press F1 to bring up the client entry screen and enter the details as per usual.

8. 		1. Total Tally Entry

This function is designed to be used prior to entering lots utilising the information provided to you on the health declarations. If you use this function for cattle entries the TB Status and the Vendor NAIT number will automatically populate when you are pre-entering lots. This section also produces a report that will show you tally discrepancies between what has been entered in your lots and what are on the vendor’s declarations.  The report can be found under option 3. Presale Printouts on the main auction screen.

To use this function either click with the mouse on option one or type 1 in to the Select Option box at the bottom of the Main Auction Screen and press enter.

This will open a search function exactly like in the customer search section described previously. Either enter the customer’s name or LAMS number to find their account. Once you have found the customer a screen should appear the same as below.

From this screen select the type of animal you are entering from the drop down box. Then enter the total number or animals of this species that are on the health declaration. i.e. if there are 3 Hfrs, 4 Strs and 6 Cows you enter a total tally of 13. Then enter the TB status of the vendor and their NAIT ID number.

If you tick the box beside With Holding Period information on ASD this line will print out on the Auction Sheets. You will still need to provide information on drench types and withholding periods in the remarks section of your lot entry.

Once you have entered this information use the mouse to click on save or hit the enter key and the screen will move back up to the search function to allow you to enter the next client.

9.. 		2. Pre Sale Lot Entry

This section is for entering your lots prior to the sale. To access it either click with the mouse on it or type 2 in to the Select Option box on the Main Auction Screen. This should bring you to the screen below.

Firstly either type the animal section that you require in to the Select Section box or use your mouse to tick the box beside the section that you want to enter lots for. Once your lot has been selected press enter again to move the cursor down to the customer search section. Here you can either search for your customer as per the customer search function of you can enter the clients LAMS number and press enter. This should bring you to the screen below.

From this screen you can enter all the details you want to put in your lot. If you push enter after each section the cursor will jump between the main entry areas however if you would like to fill in sections that it skips over simply use the up or down arrows on the keyboard to move to that section. If you have already completed the Total Tally Entry section the NAIT number and the TB Status should self populate when entering cattle.

If you have not completed this section you will need to enter the vendors NAIT number now.  Once you have entered all the information that you want to for this lot either press enter when the Save Button is highlighted or click save using the mouse.

To switch customers press F8 to return to the search screen or continue entering information under the same customer account.

10. 		3. Pre Sale Printouts

This menu is where you access all the print outs that you require prior to selling stock, this includes the auction sheets and catalogues.  To access it either click with the mouse on it or type 3 in to the Select Option box on the Main Auction Screen. This should bring you to the screen below.

10.a	Tally Reconciliation Report

This is the report that shows you whether your data entered in your pens matches the data provided to on your health declarations.  As per usual type in 1 to enter the report of click on the option with the mouse.

This should bring up a screen asking you to specify what species you are wanting to display. Use the mouse to select the species you are working with by checking the box beside it. Then click Continue. A report should appear that looks similar to the one below.

The main points to note with this report are the list that shows the pen numbers and tally in brackets beside the number and the difference which should be zero. A negative number indicates that you have entered more stock than you have entered on the health declaration and a positive number shows that you are missing that many stock from the health declaration. i.e. Diff Column -6 means you need to lose 6 more cattle to balance with the declaration, 6 means that there are 6 more cattle to find to balance with the declaration. If you have not entered a total tally entry at all the total number Diff will equal the tally column.

10b.		2. Print Sale Sheets
