Sheep EID: USER GUIDE (TOUGBOOK – Wi-Fi - & Software)


GETTING CONNECTED:

Press the Power button (top right hand corner of  TOUGHBOOK)  the  TOUGHBOOK
will load to its desktop. The standard password is; 123456


   1. Turn on the TOUGHBOOK, once it has loaded to the  desktop  you  should
      see a message in the bottom right hand corner of  the  screen  showing
      the successful connection to the Wi-Fi access point (the name  of  the
      Wi-Fi as standard is EID).
   2. You can check the connection of the Wi-Fi by  pressing  APP  button  4
      (see appendix for image) this will show the TOUGHBOOK is connected  to
      the correct Wi-Fi network. See Appendix for further Wi-Fi details.
   3. You can reconnect the mapped drive  to  the  server  by  pressing  APP
      button 3. Only do this when you know the TOUGHBOOK is connected to the
      EID Wi-Fi network (see point 2).
   4. Turn on the RDIF stick. To do this press  and  let  go  of  the  green
      button on the shaft of the RFID stick.

GETTING STARTED:

   5. Press APP button 2 to load the sheep EID software.

   6. A grid of PENS will load on the screen of the TOUGBOOK. PLEASE NOTE  a
      blue light should appear on the RFID stick to show that the  BLUETOOTH
      connection has been established between the RFID stick and  TOUGHBOOK.
      On the second line of the  RFID  stick  display  the  caption  ‘System
      Ready’ will appear.
   7. The number of RFID sticks connected to the TOUGHBOOK will be listed at
      the top of the software as Reader 1, Reader 2 etc.

   8. To allocate a Pen Number either scan the Pen Tag by pressing the green
      button on the shaft of the RFID stick or click on Reader -1 button  on
      the software and type in the number on the keyboard of the  TOUGHBOOK.
      Once this has been selected the software will show as;
[pic]
      The RFID stick display caption ‘Pen No 1’ will appear.


   9. Begin scanning the individual ear tags of the sheep in the pen you are
      in. As each one is scanned the number of scanned tags  will  increment
      in the PEN software. In the example below Pen 4 has 1 scanned  tag  in
      it and Pen 5 has 4 scanned tags in it.

  10.  If you pre-enter your sheep lots into the NAS market system  the  Pen
      will go green (see image above) when you have scanned  the  number  of
      pre-booked lots.
  11.  To view the individual ear tags within in a Pen double click  on  the
      Pen number.

  12.  To add sub lots within a pen without having to
      Manually type them in; whilst you are scanning tags in
       a pen scan the ‘sub lot tag’ (attached to top right of the TOUGHBOOK)
      the next sheep read will have an A after the pen number.

  13.  The system will not allow you to read the same ear tag  in  the  same
      pen. The RFID stick reader has a light on the end of it; it will flash
      GREEN when it reads a tag and RED when it reads the same tag again.
[pic]
  14.  If the same tag is read in two different pens the system  will  alert
      the user prompting which pen to delete the duplicate tag from.


  15.  The system allows the user the facility to ‘Find A Sheep’,
      click on the FIND A SHEEP button
      in the top right hand of the software
      and then scan the sheep tag. The software
      will then show which pen that sheep belongs to.

GETTING CONFIGURED (If you need to):

  16.  To check the configuration of the RFID
      stick reader, click on ‘Settings’ and then
      ‘EID Reader1’. Set the relevant COM Port
      (only do this if you know which COM PORT
      you are using, if you are unsure  contact  NEWLINE  ASP).  Choose  the
      relevant RFID stick reader.

The PENS in BLUE indicate TAGS read in the EID sys-
tem, the total number does not tally with the market system  (or  stock  has
not been booked into the market system at this time).  If  stock  is  to  be
entered into the market system after the sheep TAGS have been read  go  into
the above option all the PENS should go green. Any PENS still blue  indicate
a discrepancy between what has been read in  the  yard  and  what  has  been
entered into the market system.

APPENDIX:


Charging & Power:

    • The TOUGHBOOK must be fully charged after each time it is used. It can
      be charged by being placed correctly in its docking  station  (docking
      station needs to be connected to mains power) or  by  the  PSU  (power
      supply unit) supplied with the TOUGHBOOK.

    • The RFID stick must be charged after each use. To do this unscrew  the
      red cap end of the handle, carefully remove the 4  x  AA  rechargeable
      batteries and place them in the mains powered charge. PLEASE NOTE: the
      lights of the charger will flash  (two  flashing  lights)  whilst  the
      batteries are charging.  The  RED  lights  will  go  static  once  the
      batteries are charged.














    • The Wi-Fi access point must always be left turned on. If it is  turned
      off the TOUGHBOOK will NOT connect the rest of the  system  and  ‘real
      time’ element of the system will be compromised.

What’s on the TOUGHBOOK:

There are four APP (application) buttons on  the  right  hand  side  of  the
TOUGHBOOK as you look at it. As a standard these will do the following;

   1. Load the BLUETOOTH connection software
   2. Load the Sheep EID software
   3. Map the network drive. (normally the z: drive)
   4. Load the Wi-Fi connection software

The TOUGHBOOK should also have a lot splitting tag attached to it  (normally
on the top right hand side of the unit).

System Parameters (how the elements of the system connect):


The RFID stick reader connects to the TOUGHBOOK via a BLUETOOTH  connection.
Theoretically this can link up to 100 meters. In  practice  in  a  livestock
yard circa 60 meters seems to be achievable.

The TOUGHBOOK connects to the main office via the Wi-Fi (industrial)  access
point (this will generally be on a wall or in the roofing of a shed).

The Wi-Fi access point connects back  to  the  market  server  in  the  main
office network via a cat5e network cable.

These individual elements make up one  real  time  system,  this  means  the
second a tag is read in the yard it is immediately stored in the  data  base
on the server.

Wi-Fi Notes:


It is important that users familiarize themselves with the range of the  Wi-
Fi network. The software will not work outside the range of  the  EID  Wi-Fi
network, unless the TOUGHBOOK is housed in a docking station  with  a  cat5e
network cable connecting it to the main network.

All other Wi-Fi networks should have the word EXCLUDED  by  them.  To  check
this, press APP button 4 and you’ll see a list  of  Wi-Fi  networks  in  the
vicinity. If in any doubt contact Newline.

A green Fan icon will appear in  the  system  tray  when  the  TOUGHBOOK  is
successfully connected to a Wi-Fi network. The number of green bars  on  the
fan is the signal strength, the more the number  of  bars  the  greater  the
signal.


-----------------------
The next tag you read will also have A after the pen number, to allocate a
B after the pen number scan the ‘sub lot tag’ then scan the next sheep tag
and so on. Click on the exit button when finished in the pen.



To delete the tags in an individual pen click on the ‘Delete All Tags’
button.
To manually input tags in a pen click on the ‘Manual Input’ box and type in
the individual number.

SUB LOTS: To add sub lots in this screen click on the relevant ear tag in
the pen number cell and add the sub lot letter, e.g. A,B,C.


Choose the relevant sale; this can be done with your finger, the TOUGHBOOK
plectrum or by using the arrow and keys to move down to the sale.
Press the ‘select sale’ button.


PLEASE NOTE: The system sets the appropriate Baud Rate, Data Bits, Stop
Bits, Parity & Handshaking, the user DOES NOT need to change these.
Once the relevant stick has been selected please tick ‘Com Port active’
If you are intending on using this RFID stick reader. If this is not done
the Reader button at the top of the software will not appear.


Enter the Pen Number the click in the EID Number Text Box and scan the
relevant PEN tag, click on the Save button



PLEASE NOTE: To reconnect the BLUETOOTH link between RFID stick reader and
TOUGHBOOK click in the appropriate Reader button and type in the next Pen
to scan, the system will reconnect the BLUETOOTH link if it has dropped
out.


Replace the batteries with the Green dot on the battery pack on the same
side as the green on/off button on the RFID stick.



The PENS in GREEN indicate the same number of TAGS read compared to the
number of sheep entered in that PEN in the market system.



Number 10: Auto Print EID Tags will default to Y for Yes.
When the invoice is produced the EID Tags document will print.
Set the Auto Print EID Tags to N – No if you do not want the EID to
automatically print out with the invoice.
