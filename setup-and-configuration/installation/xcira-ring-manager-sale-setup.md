We are working in Lane 3 at the moment. Click on select once it is selected in the drop down list

To delete an event click on the ‘Delete Event’ button

Click on Delete to confirm that you want to delete the selected auction

The system will confirm that the event has been deleted.

Click on the home tab at the top right of the form.

To setup a new event click on the green button ‘Create New Events’

Enter a start and end date, change the time zone to (GMT) Western Europe, enter Event ID in the above format (will be auto generated by NAS eventually). Enter an Event title for the online buyers to see. Click on Create A New Event button.

Once this is done you’ll be taken back to the home page with the sale details on it.

NOTE: for the bidders to be able to log into the sale you will need to transfer the registered bidders from Ringmanager to the sale (until we have our own registration process). Below is how to do it.

Click on the Data Transfer tab (far right of the main menu)

Click on the Transfer Attendees button.

To confirm you click on the Yes button.

WE DO NOT NEED TO TRANSFER INVENTORY AS THIS WILL BE DONE BY THE XML LINK UP FROM NAS.
