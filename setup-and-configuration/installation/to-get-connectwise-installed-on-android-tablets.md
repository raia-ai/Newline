To get Connectwise installed on Android tablets, go through normal support steps of creating a support session

then direct the user to https://connect.newlineasp.com and give the code to the customer

and they will be prompted to install the connectwise software after clicking install

The install will then change to open which they need to click

They will need to confirm the next couple of screens

They may need to agree to a privacy policy

At which point we will have a remote session established

If you go back to the Tablet Home page you should see the connectwise icon

Open this up and click on open active connections

This will open the following click on the plus sign in the bottom right
