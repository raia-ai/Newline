                                  NIFAIS June 2025
       Deployment for Export Assembly Centres (EAC)

The following programs will need to be sent to all Export Assembly Centres (EAC):

GovServices (see separate document)

EAC.EXE

NIFAISLOGIN.EXE

(will add minimum versions after final testing)




The menu options and the results screens in the system are the same as before, it’s just some of
the progress screens will look slightly different when sending.



The first thing when NIFAIS goes live (over the last weekend of June) the user should go into the
View System Settings option from the main menu




And use the “Login to NIFAIS” button to log in for the first time.
