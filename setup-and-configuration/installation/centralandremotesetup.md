CENTRAL & REMOTE MARKET SETUP FILES

DIRNUM – IS A FILE WHICH RECORDS THE NUMBER OF  MARKET  DIRECTORIES  AT  THE
CENTRAL SITE AND SEQUENTAIL NUMBERS AT THE REMOTE SITE.

E.G. AT HALLWORTHY THERE IS A MARKET DIRECTORY AND AN OTM DIRECTORY. IN  THE
MARKET DIRECTORY DIRNUM SHOULD READ 1. IN THE OTM DIRECTORY IT SHOULD BE  2.
EACH DIRECTORY SHOULD HAVE A UNIQUE SEQUENTIAL  NUMBER,  UNLESS  THE  REMOTE
SITE HAS THE SAME NAMED DIRECTORY THEN DIRNUM SHOULD HAVE  THE  SAME  NUMBER
IN BOTH DIRECTORIES. THIS IS THE CASE FOR THE HATHER  DIRECTORY  WHICH  WILL
RECIDE IN BOTH SITES.

AT HATHERLEIGH DIRNUM SHOULD BE 3, BEING THE SEQUENTIAL FOLLOW ON TO  MARKET
AND OTM.

DIRMAST.CNT – IS THE TOTAL OF ALL THE DIRNUMS PLUS  1.  THE  REPRESENTS  THE
NEXT RECORD AVAILBLE FOR USE. THIS FILE MUST GO IN THE DEBTDIR DIRECTORY  AT
THE CENTRAL SITE. I.E. THE DIRECTORY WHERE THE DEBTS ARE STORED.

MAINMKT.COM – MUST BE ON THE ROUTE OF THE CENTRAL SERVER  AND  ON  NO  OTHER
PC. THE FILE MUST EXIST AND CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS HAVING JUST Y IN IT.

DATATRAN.1 AND DATATRAN.2  SHOULD  BE  COPIED  AS  DATATRAN  TO  THE  MARKET
DIRECTORY FOR TRANSFER AT THE RESPECTIVE SITES. DATATRAN.1  AT  THE  CENTRAL
SITE AND DATATRAN.2 AT THE REMOTE SITE.  THESE  FILES  TRANSFER  THE  MARKET
DEBTS, CHEQ REC AND POST THE DEBTS.

DEBTFILE – IS CREATED AUTOMATICALLY FOR YOU.

VERY IMPORTANT.

The system for unzipping relies on the receiving modem  machine  having  the
download sub-directory on the C: drive. The server or central  computer  has
the download sub directory directory on the debtdir drive.
