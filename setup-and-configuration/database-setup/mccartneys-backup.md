McCartneys Backup (Ludlow)
                             Before Backing Up.

1. Things to remember before Backing up information.

(A) You have chosen to backup files from a number of machines in the
office, therefore always ensure that these machines are all switched on
when you are going to backup your information.


(B) You can check these machine are on the network by double clicking the
‘My Computer’ icon on the desktop of the terminal server computer (See
figure 1).

(C) This will open a window that shows all network connections (see figure
2), you are able to view the machines that are mapped to it, when you can
see that all the machines are mapped to the terminal server and that there
are no red crosses thru the connections you are ready to continue.

                                 (Figure 2)

up media or file name’(see figure 4), in the text box below should be

it in, f:\full1.bkf.

open a new window, ensure that ‘Replace the data on the media with this
backup’ is selected (see figure 5), you can tell if it is highlighted
