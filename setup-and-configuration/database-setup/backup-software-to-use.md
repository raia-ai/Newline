Software to use:

NOVA
NERO 6
Microsoft Backup

Backup Type must be full and overwrite all files, under no circumstances
are we to use incremental. Any new backup installations set up as
incremental will be liable to a written warning for staff involved.

For :-

DAT
USB Hard Drives

The MARKET folder MYSQL & ARCHIVE should be backed up and all other DAILY
MARKET FOLDERS should be backed up daily. This will take longer than
backing up just MARKET, but it provides a proper safe guard.
