NEWLINE SOFTWARE UPDATE 3 General Improvements, MySQL & BUG FIXES – October
2003

To Install from the CD
Put the CD in the CDROM drive. It should auto run. Click the “Start  Update”
button.
You should then see messages about files being copied and it will  tell  you
that it has completed and press any key to exit.

Musts
NB. There are a few things you must do for the update to work properly.
   1) If your firm has multiple sites each site must  be  updated  within  2
      days of each other, but preferably the same day.
   2) You need to go into the Installation Menu in each  market  folder  you
      run, and into the Amend Animal Type Settings,  and  pick  any  of  the
      Animal Types and just press the return key to move through the  pages.
      Nothing will appear to happen but it runs an  important  program  that
      will ensure the market system will run as it should.
   3) Go into the Installation menu in the main MARKET folder.  Pick  option
      10 End of Market Reports to Print. If you use Sage in conjunction with
      the market make sure Report 19 has a Y next to it. If you do  not  use
      Sage this must be set to N, otherwise you will experience problems  in
      the end of market reports.
   4) Run Program Update on all workstations
   5) Check the printer settings on printers used to print the End of Market
      Reports
   6) Put through some dummy lots and print  off  a  test  bill  and  cheque
      before running a live sale.

General Direction of Updates
Newline are  constantly  improving  and  developing  new  software.  We  are
writing new programs to increase the services that our package provides  and
improving existing programs.  One  such  improvement  is  the  rewriting  of
existing programs from the normal blue screen non  mouse  programs,  to  the
new windows like mouse enabled programs. All these new programs have  a  new
print method that allows the user to print to any printer. The new  programs
are written in Visual Basic and as I say are much more  windows  orientated,
they provide benefits to our programmers who can do far more with  them  and
they are quicker to use in terms of setting things up at the user end.

Specific Updates

OTMs
The price set for OTMs changes every month, but is always the same for  that
month and clients have been asking us “why do they always have to enter  the
same price in over and over again when booking OTMs through”. Well  now  you
don’t, because in the animal type settings in the installation menu you  can
set a Set Price against the OTM animal type. This is the fourth page of  the
animal type settings, with all the Yes and No answers. If you want to use  a
Set Price select the line number to amend, and press enter until the  cursor
is under the appropriate heading, then enter the price in pounds  and  pence
and press the enter key. The default setting is the  price  entered  in  the
installation, but it can be over written by entering a different  price  and
pressing return at the price prompt: - You will need to  change  it  in  the
installation whenever the OTM price changes but it will  save  you  entering
in the price over and over again every time you book an OTM through.

Reserve Price
A new reserve price feature has been added to the system. Again this is  set
up in the animal type settings in the installation menu. If you say  Yes  in
the reserve field in the animal types it  will  prompt  you  for  a  reserve
price when pre-booking items.

VAT
For clients that have agreed to use standard cheque and bill  stationary  it
is possible to take advantage of being able to set up any animal type to  be
either vatable or non vatable, this is particularly useful for clients  that
sell furniture or  implements  through  the  market  system,  or  any  other
vatable items. This is also set up  in  the  animal  types  program  in  the
installation menu. It is also the fourth page, as  above  with  the  reserve
and set price features. If you have standard stationary and  are  interested
in using this facility we may need to make some changes to your  cheque  and
bill program. If you do not have standard stationary this  facility  is  not
available.

BCMS
If markets scan all their tags then in the installation set Email BCMS to
"N" then when the passport is scanned the software knows it's a new
passport and flags the transaction for emailing to BCMS.

Turnover Analysis
Now allows for up to 50 different animal types per section

Lot Entry
In the box input part you are no longer prompted for Animal Type but this
can be altered by the line amendment.

SAMU
Scotland only. Now shows the invalid flock no's in  red  and  these  can  be
amended by D/clicking on the red cells in question.

New End of Market Reports

There is a separate set of  instructions  included  to  provide  a  detailed
explanation for this, but basically it gives the user the ability  to  print
the report to a printer of their choice and to not have to  print  loads  of
unwanted reports. It also gives the user the  ability  to  print  historical
reports (only starting from when they first get this software).

Additional End of Market Report
There is a new end of market report for sage users. It will post the  market
totals to sage. If you do not use sage please make sure that this option  is
set to N in the installation menu, in option 10 End  of  Market  Reports  to
Print. Set Post Market Totals to Sage to N for No.

Salering2000 Bug Fixes and alterations
      There was a bug with reselling lots  in  the  salering  program.  This
      created duplicate lots. This bug has been fixed in the latest version.


      Salering2000 - Changing Sections
      1. Option to change selling section without having to exit back to the
      desktop and re load the program again. If you click on the End  button
      on the Enter Next Lot number form you will get  a  prompt  to  'Change
      Sections Y/N". If you say Y to this you get the setup screen appear so
      that you can select a different market or section and the program will
      run on from there. If you say N you get the normal exit  salering  Y/N
      option.


      Salering2000 - Reselling Lots
      2. If you bring up a lot that has already been sold then when  you  go
      to sell the current lot you get the price and the purchaser  from  the
      sold lot. Markets have been finding this confusing and I have  removed
      this now.


      3. When the message box appears saying this lot has already been  sold
      you now get the lot number, price, eartag and purchaser  so  you  know
      exactly which lot you are saying Yes to.


       Salering2000 – Enter Remarks
      4. You can now enter remarks for the lot that  you  are  entering  the
      price for. If you press F4 you can enter the price for the lots on the
      main screen and if you press SHIFT + F4 you can enter remarks for  the
      lot that you are currently selling.

Extra Deductions
This program  has  been  updated  into  a  more  contemporary  windows  type
program, with mouse functionality. It is quicker and easier to use  and  has
the added functionality of being able to add a  minimum  and  maximum  price
against the deduction.

Market Names and Holding Numbers
This program  has  been  updated  into  a  more  contemporary  windows  type
program, with mouse functionality. It provides  the  ability  to  hold  more
information about the market, such as the market address which is  used  for
the Sheep Movement Licences. It also provides the user with the  ability  to
turn off certain lot booking questions like, field rep and batching.  Saying
No by putting an N against them and pressing  F5  to  save,  will  stop  the
questions being asked when entering lots.

Prebook Lots
No longer asks for salering number if answer to Terminal in Salering is No.

Credit Cards
Some markets are beginning to accept  credit  card  payments.  Newline  have
developed a program to deal with this. It is a chargeable  facility,  please
call for details if you are interested.

New Stock Analysis
Newline have developed a new rapid searching archive  database  that  almost
half of our clients have already purchased and are making  keen  use  of  to
procure stock by effective targeting of customers. This program is  flexible
and provides accurate records of who buys or sells what, in what  quantities
and for what price and when.  It  provides  crucial  information  for  stock
procurement and is helping improve efficiency when  searching  for  specific
stock types, and breeds. It is being  continually  improved  and  developed,
below are a number of brief bug fixes or enhancements.

v1.1.18
- added heads and turnover to Nontrading report
- added sections on printout
 - fixed purchaser side analysis.
 - added buyername to Groupby Buyer drilldown
  -  (fixed  bug  in  DisplayQueryResultsInGrid  in  the  customer   address
expansion code)
 - added CheckRowHeights

- fixed bug in RepReport where gross totals were being  overwritten  in  the
grid by the period totals!
 - Enlarged tablesarray
 - fixed layouts of history report printouts (changed to right align)

New Contact Management
Clients using the new archive database have the option of buying  a  contact
management system that lets them record customer calls and  produce  reports
with follow up dates.

New Fieldsman/Rep Report
In the During the Sale menu, select the Market  Reports  option,  then  pick
Rep Reports. This program is used to assign reps  to  lots  that  they  have
procured. This information can then be  used  for  management  purposes  and
commission reasons.

Movelot
This program is used to produce catalogues for pre-entered sales. It can  be
used to transfer lots from one sale to another if they have not  been  sold.
It  can   be   used   create   an   upload   file   to   book   sales   onto
www.auctionmarts.com . This program has been altered to  print  the  age  of
animals in months and days and not just months. It is also altered  so  that
if the user does not want  to  print  the  vendor's  name  or  address  then
everything moves over to the left. There is a new print routine  being  used
so it can be printed to any network printer.

Valid Eartag Formats
|UK123456789012                  |All numeric tag has no spaces in|
|                                |it.                             |

|                                |a space between the herd number |
|                                |and tag number.                 |

Lot Deletion Bug
There was a bug that caused duplicate lots on the purchaser  side  if  there
was already an invoice and the lot was deleted in the lot deletion  program,
it would take the lot off the vendor side but not the purchaser  side,  this
is now fixed.

Lot Edit
Lot Edit has been made easier to use with less prompts involved  to  improve
speed when editing. There is no longer the need to enter an L to search  for
a lot number, the user just enters the lot number. The first prompt  in  lot
edit is now “Field To Amend”. The user just  enters  the  field  number  and
presses enter and can then make the amendment. This negates having to  enter
a 1 to Amend Field and then the “Field to Amend”.

Salering 2000 Small Printer Bug
Fixed in this version

Customer Edit F8 Exit Bug
Fixed

See Purchaser Record
The first prompt is now:
VIEW JUST OUTSTANDING DEBTS Y/N. (The default is Y)
If the user enters a name and they have selected outstanding from the  first
prompt then only the customers matching that name that  owe  money  will  be
displayed. Once the customer's name and address are shown  the  next  prompt
is RETURN to View Detail or F8 to Exit. IF F8 is pressed it should  go  back
to the Purchaser Name or Number Prompt and then F8 at this point  takes  you
back to the menu. The Record Number or Date option are still  available  but
“R” for Record Number is the default. Pressing RETURN would is the  same  as
entering R. Pressing RETURN at the next prompt record number to  print  from
would default to 1. Once the details are on the  screen  the  options  P  to
Print or Return for Menu. Return takes the user back to the  Purchaser  name
or number prompt. P prints out the  details  on  the  screen.  If  the  user
selects By Date then prompt for the  start  date  and  then  if  they  press
RETURN to the end date use todays date as the end date.  If  both  date  and
record number cases if the user selects  just  outstanding  transactions  at
the start then do not look at the archive  folder  for  transactions  as  no
outstanding transactions can be archived.

Print Sale Sheets

There is a new sale sheet option that allows the user to print to  either  a
dot matrix printer or a laser printer.

I would think it would be useful to display all of the lots on screen  first
so that the user can see what has been entered and then  to  give  them  the
option to select the first lot number to print and then the last lot  number
to print. Give them the new select a printer option and then print  out  the
sale sheet.

Make the section selection keyboard driven. Currently you have to  click  on
this with the mouse.

Can the screen go slightly wider or is it set at 800 x 600? If  it  is  then
we need to make the font size slightly  smaller  on  the  section  names  as
currently it wraps around if you have 14 chars as a section description.

Have the age frame not visible until a section has been  selected  and  that
section is a animal type section. Currently it is not enabled  but  you  can
still see it and it does not apply to Fine Art sales.

With regards to the printout. Can we move the customer  number  over  to  be
infront of the customer name or even on a  line  above  the  customer  name.
This will mean that we can get rid of this column from the printout.

Can we set the Print Blank Lots tick box to be on by default.

I think we could remove the Guide Price from the sale sheets  also  so  this
will give us more room to increase the font  size  and  hopefully  stop  the
need to go to landscape.

Once the sale sheets have been printed does it update the pre lot file  that
these lots have been printed out. If not can we get it to do this  and  then
when we list the lots on the screen can we put an * before  the  lot  number
for all lots that have been printed out already.

It would then be good to have option 2 from the menu running  the  new  sale
sheet program so that the user can pick the  section  and  the  system  will
just list all entered lots that have not been printed out in  the  list.  We
could then have the option to print these from this routine also.

Vendor Notification Letter

a notification letter printout program. This will be  a  list  of  all  lots
entered for each vendor with reserves and short descriptions. It  will  need
to have a message at the bottom.

This I think will need to be a new VB programas we might have to  print  out
the full description. I would like to see the  program  first  do  a  market
sort so that all vendors with  transactions  will  printout  in  full  alpha
order. This display all vendors names and addresses on screen  so  that  the
user can printout letters for all vendors or just a selected few.

We will need to introduce a flag in the MySql table for Notification  letter
printed so that we can flag to the user anyone who  has  not  had  a  letter
printed.

I think there should be the option to printout just the  short  description,
just the full description or both. It might be useful to also give them  the
option to print out reserve and also price guide.

It also might help if we have a section selection  also.  They  should  have
the option to be able to select more than one section at a time.

The lots will need to be listed in lot number order.

We will need to printout a declaration  at  the  bottom  of  each  of  these
letters so will need a program to input this in. Currently I would  look  to
alter the cheque message program but to give them  the  option  to  input  a
message of 8 lines but the full width of the page.

Would be good to have the option at the end  of  a  sale  to  print  out  an
UNSOLD NOTIFICATION LETTER option so that a letter informing the vendor  can
be sent out informing them that these lots have not  been  sold  and  giving
them different options. We would need a different  message  option  so  that
the message at the bottom of the letter can be different from the  Pre  Sale
Notification Letters.

When printing out the lot details can we check the head file and  if  it  is
just set to print out the remarks then do not  print  out  the  animal  type
description. Just print out the remarks.

Need to either have the option to print out the breed or just  work  on  the
basis that if the system is set to just print out remarks then do not  print
out the breed description.

If we have the option to print breed then set this as per the salesheets.

It also did not seem to update the flag to tell me  that  I  had  printed  a
letter out for a vendor. I printed out a single  letter  for  a  vendor  and
then went back into the program and it did not tell me that I  have  printed
out any letters.

      General Look and Navigation
      A lot of work  has  been  done  to  smarten  up  the  grids  and  make
      navigation easier and keep a continuity of  look  as  the  user  moves
      through and back from drill down options.


      Select Breakdown
      To filter a section search further by animal type tick  the  tick  box
      titled Section Breakdown. If this box is ticked when the  user  clicks
      on the run analysis button a new form appears with all of  the  animal
      types from the sections selected. The user will  have  the  option  to
      select any number of these animal types. There is also want  a  weight
      range option. This will be from...... to ......   Under this there  is
      a CID option. There is a Continue button for the user to press / click
      and this will then run the query and display the results as normal.


      Select Postcode
      To filter searches by postcode, tick the  Select  Postcode  tick  box.
      Type in the postcode or part of it that you  want  to  search  by  and

      back to the main stock analysis screen for the user to enter different
      search criteria. When this query is run the results are  displayed  on
      the screen and there is  another  button  Merge  Query.  If  the  user
      selects this option the results displayed on  the  screen  are  merged
      with the results in the temp table. If the customer is already in  the
      temp table then the number of heads and amount from the new record  is
      added to the details already in the table and if the customer  is  not
      in the temp table then their details are added. Once this  information
      has been added to the temp table the  Merge  Query  button  disappears
      from view and is replaced by a view merged details. If this button  is
      selected then all of the information from the temp table is  displayed
      in the normal grid ready for printing / saving as normal.
