Salering
It is now possible to edit lots that have been entered into the salering software by double clicking
the list of lots already sold in the bottom right of the salering screen. A lot edit facility as shown
below will be displayed. There is a separate help document explaining this feature in more detail.




There is also a new feature for sites that weigh cattle but do not have an automatic link between the
weigh bridge and laptop (i.e. they have a manual weight system and need to type the weight into
the laptop). The system enables the user to add the next weight before the last lot is sold and still be
able to alter details on the current lot. Again more details available in separate salering document.
Invoices




Intake lot and time printout
At some marts sellers like a printout of the lots they are unloading and an approximate sale time.
This enables them to go about their business without having to hang around for ages and come back
at the right time to see their lots being sold. There is separate documentation for more details.

Bug Fixes / Performance Enhancements
The export lot report has been optimized so it is quicker to load within sales. It has also been altered
so linked sales can be viewed together in the export lot report.

A bug in the cheque app when trying to print an unsold NI sheep licence to an invalid herd number
has been fixed.

There have been a few tweaks and bug fixes for the new pay old debts option.

There have been a number of bug fixes for Aphis sheep movements and better displays for animal
errors reported back from Aphis. (balance ver 7.0.277)
