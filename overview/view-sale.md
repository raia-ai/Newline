View sale

The view sale option provides an audit of how the lots were sold. In what order they were sold in.

To view the current sale select the sale from the sale list and select the section from the drop down combo. Click the start button.

A grid with lot details. Lot number, manifest number, type, wt and price may be seen. Along with the seller and buyer info. This program poles automatically and will sit on top of the desktop to show the next lot as it is sold.

In the UK it may be used to sort buyer cattle passports as the lot is sold.
