If the seller is setup and you have their bank details stored in the customer account, you will see the action choice screen.

Options Menu

Display Sort Option

If this option is ticked a pop up message will appear for the user to select the sort option each time they select print. This option is normally not required as the auction firm often sets their default preference and leaves it as that. A few auctions have different clients wanting different sort orders and therefore find it useful to prompt at the point of printing.

See sort lot by for more details below.

Sort Lots By

The user may be asked by the seller to print out the seller statement or seller list in a particular order. Some may prefer the printout to be numerical others may want it in the order of sale (e.g. when a pool \ draw is taken and the sale does not start from lot number 1 and flow sequentially but instead may start at any number and the lot order jump about).

Do not sort lots

The lots will print out in the order they were entered into the system.

By Lot No

The lots will print out in numerical order

By section, then lot no

The lot will be grouped by section and printed in numerical order within the section.

Printers

For system and processing speed NAS enables the user to pre-set which seller print jobs will come out of which printer, which tray (to enable different colour paper to be used for specific printouts, or pre-printed stationary for specific printouts). This is done in the options > printers menu via the options below.

The user chooses the printout option they require and selects the appropriate printer. It is important to know what font size your stationary is pre-configured for.

NB: It will only print out correctly at the pre-configured font size.

The user may set the printout to produce any number of copies by default.

Statement

See contras for more information.

Display

Some auctions will want to give the seller the buyers name. It may be customary to give the buyer luck money. This enables the seller to find the buyer and thank them.

It may be handy to show reserves on the screen to help the clerks answer questions from buyers that just missed winning the lot. Or help staff trying to sell the lot after the sale get near or above the reserve price with a private deal.
