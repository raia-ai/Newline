                     Deployment for NI Markets/EACs

Overview:

The government body/system which manages livestock movement information in Northern
Ireland is APHIS (Animal and Public Health Information System), although this is
transitioning to a new system called NIFAIS (Northern Ireland Food Animal Information
System) They are essentially two parts of the same overall system - for example the
reporting of Cattle movements has already been moved over to NIFAIS from APHIS, and this
June update is about the move over to NIFAIS for the reporting of Sheep/Goat movements.



Background:

When animals move between places (farms, markets, abbatoirs, export assembly centres) in
Northern Ireland they are accompanied by various bits of paper (“movement documents”),
and these have unique serial numbers on them.

Each place that the animals can move between is allocated a Flock number that identifies
that location and the owner/operator {?}

For animals being exported out of Northern Ireland, they cannot be exported straight from a
market, they need to go to an approved Export Assembly Centre (EAC) and they are then
exported from there. These EACs are a bit like markets except they only deal with animals
being exported.



Coming to Market

The seller of the animals will have a book of these movement documents provided to him by
APHIS/NIFAIS, with pre-printed serial numbers on the forms. (I think) When NIFAIS issue
these books they keep a record of which Flock number the book and serial numbers was
given to. (These are the “F document numbers”) When that seller wants to take animals to
market he/she/they{editthis} will fill out a movement document with the details of the
animals and the flock number (like a holding or CPH number in England) of where the
animals are coming from, and the market they are going to.
(There’s actually a whole lot more info on the form like details of the haulier, expected journey time,
etc! but this doesn’t concern us currently).

This form will arrive at the market with the animals, and the information is entered into
NAS. This is called the INWARD or ON movement – the animals are coming Into or Onto
the market, and each animal is assigned the F document number that it came in on.
Leaving the Market

When the animals later need to leave the market, the same things applies; more movement
information needs to be recorded – the animals are moving out of the market to the next
destination. This is called the ONWARD or OFF movement.

The market will have been assigned a range of serial numbers by NIFAIS for the OFF paper-
work. These are the “G document numbers”

(When they are running low on these numbers, the system will notify the user and they can
then request more from NIFAIS electronically. This is known as Downloading More
Document Numbers)

When a buyer is invoiced (or if the animal is unsold, the unsold passout is produced for the
seller) he/she/they{editthis} will tell the market where the animals are going to - the system
allocates the next unused G document number and prints another movement document,
showing the destination flock number and listing the animals on that document. This
movement document must then travel with the animals when they are transported out of
the market.

The market then sends electronic versions of these forms, detailing where any particular
animal is coming from and going to, to NIFAIS.

Example movement info:

INWARD movement: Animal A moved from Billy Joel (flock number 123456), in to the
market (flock number 777888) travelling on movement document F000100001. So we know
where the animal moved from and where it moved to, and the number of the movement
document it was recorded on.

ONWARD movement: Animal A then moved out of the market (flock number 777888) to the
farmer Billy Gibbons (flock number 654321) on movement document G000200002. So again
we know where the animal moved from and where it moved to, and the number of the
movement document it was recorded on.

All these paper movement forms are required to be sent to NIFAIS where they will enter all
the extra details on to the system.

So in the event that any particular animal’s movements need to be traced, the system will
have the details of all the journeys it made and the locations it was at, how it was
transported and who transported them (and more importantly for traceability in disease
control, which other animals were in contact with this animal at any particular point!)
