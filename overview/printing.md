NAS printing

The NAS system is based on a number of program modules blended together as one auction system. There are a couple of different print routines with the NAS system.

Latest printing module

This printing module is being added to each NAS module moving forward. The first module it was used in is the buyer invoice module.

How it works.

Module

When you load a print job you may see the module and job in the top right of the screen.

In this example the user has selected the invoice printer. The settings will be used for each invoice that is printed.

Scope

Scope gives the user choices to make the system flexible and efficient.

System default scope

The system default scope may be used so that whatever is set up against the default will be used by default for all NAS users printing that type of print job. For example, if the auction firm had one printer that all buyer invoices should come out on this would be the ideal way to set the scope up.

Add new scope

When you click the add a new scoped setting icon you will see this form.

Decide what scope filter you require and give the scope a description.

In this example the user typed Invoice Printer 1 in the description textbox and ticked the user option button. Once the user clicks the save button they will see the scope type is This User.

Select the printer

From the printer list high light the printer you wish to use.

Select the font and orientation

NB: The invoice layout will be pre-configured to fit on a specific font size. Do not alter the font size on buyer invoice layout.

Print preview

If the user ticks this option they will see a print preview screen before the printout occurs.

The user may decide to print by clicking the printer icon in the top left. Save the result to pdf or email the output.

Copies

The user may want a default number of copies to print (other than 1) each time this print option is chosen. Select the number as required.

Select tray

The user may select the printer tray they wish to use by default. This may be helpful if specific printouts are set to come out on different colour paper or pre-printed stationary (such as laser cheques).

Company graphic \ overlay

The user may select a jpg that is used on this printout for the company logo and T&Cs. The user may click the browse button to set this up.

Previous printing module

There are some limitations in the previous module which is why the new module has been developed. The limitations are not insurmountable but a little less efficient than new method.

No tray select option.

No overlay browse for the user.

Per work station set up.

Additional setup in windows control panel printer settings.

Select printer

Select the printer from the list of printers installed.

Copies

Enter the default number of copies you require each time the printout is run.

Per workstation setup required

All of the above settings are on a per workstation basis. They need to be set up on each user \ workstation profile.
