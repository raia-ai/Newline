Export Assembly Centers (EACs)

Newline’s EAC Software enables sheep exporters in Northern  Ireland  running
export assembly centers (EACs) to read electronically tagged  sheep  into  a
collection centre. Assign the sheep to batches if required  and  record  the
movement into the EAC and the batch records to Aphis  off.  Informing  DARNI
of the movement(s).

To begin using the software double click the EAC Software icon.

[pic]

The user is shown the EAC EID Menu. The first thing to do is setup  /  start
new collection. Either type 1. and press the enter / return key or  use  the
mouse and click the label 1. Start New Collection.

[pic]



When the collection is closed some menu options are  disabled  until  a  new
collection is opened.

[pic]


Start New Collection

[pic]

The System only allows one collection to be open at a time (to  comply  with
department rules). If a collection is already open it  will  warn  the  user
and inform them they must close the open one first.

[pic]

Aphis does not facilitate a web  service  to  automatically  set  up  a  new
collection. You must phone them and do this manually.  It  is  important  to
open the collection on the EAC program with the same date as the  collection
Aphis have set up.

Enter the Collection Start date and press the enter key. Select  the  export
destination, either GB, Ireland, or  another  country.  Enter  the  Type  of
Trade and click the Save button when you’re ready.



[pic]

[pic]

[pic]

The Main Menu will then show what sort of collection you have open  and  the
destination and type of trade.

[pic]







Move Animals On To EAC

[pic]

2. Move Animals On To EAC allows a user to record the movement  date,  flock
number, F document number, breed, age and sex. The user should  enter  these
details and then click the Enter Batch No button (if you  know  where  these
sheep will be going), or the Start Scanning button if you just want to  scan
them in without allocating them to a batch at the  moment.  Once  the  start
scanning button has been clicked, you will be asked if  the  blue  light  on
the stick has  been  illuminated,  if  it  is  continue,  if  not  you  must
investigate why the Bluetooth has not connected.  Use the EID stick to  read
the sheep eartags. Press the button briefly  within  a  few  inches  of  the
eartag. The light at the end of the stick should go green  if  the  read  is
successful. If it goes red the tag has already been read.

[pic]

NB: You must complete  the  Movement  date,  it  must  correspond  with  the
license date, Flock Number of where the sheep came from (check the  license)
and the F Doc Number – the license number.  It is critical that this  detail
is entered as is on the license.

You can only scan one license at a time into the export  centre.   You  must
complete the license before you start on another.  When  you  have  finished
scanning the animals you must then finish this form and start  another  form
entering the next license number details and begin scanning sheep into  this
one.  You cannot mix sheep in different license  numbers  when  scanning  on
for the first time.  They can be mixed once the license has been  completely
scanned into the centre.  This is done using Option 3.

NB-1.  You should not change any of the settings under  Reader  Settings  or
Settings without consultation with Newline staff.

Before you start adding data to the centre  you  must  click  on  the  Enter
Batch Number button.  This will display the following menu:

[pic]

To add a new batch double click on the new batch row.   The  next  available
batch number will be displayed on the right of the  screen  and  you  should
then enter a Description of the Batch e.g. Dawn Meats – Lambs.  If  you  are
happy with this click on save.

If you want to add sheep to an existing batch you can  click  on  the  batch
and it will be displayed completed in the right of the form. Click save  and
you will then be back at the following menu:

[pic]

You are now ready to start entering data into the Collection  Centre.   This
can be done in three ways:

     a. By clicking Start Scanning.  This will scan EID tags directly  into
        the form below the button and will increment  the  numbers  in  How
        Many Read.


     b. Download from Reader.  This option can  be  used  to  download  the
        memory  from  the  reader  into  the   form   creating   the   list
        automatically from the reader.


     c. Enter Manual Tag.  This option should be use to enter a tag  number
        of a sheep that does not have an EID tag or has lost its  EID  tag.
        It must be entered as it is on the tag.


Start Scanning

We are now ready to start scanning.  To do so click on  the  Start  Scanning
Button.  [pic]

Once clicked you will be presented with the following message:
[pic]

You are now ready to read the tags.  Place the stick in the  center  of  the
head and press the green button.  The stick will bleep  and  a  green  light
will appear at the end  of  the  stick.   The  counter  on  the  stick  will
increment by 1 and the data will  start  populating  the  screen  below  the
start scanning button.  The ‘How Many  Read’  will  also  increment  as  the
sheep are read.  Once complete, click on the cross on the right of the  form
and the data will be saved.

You can add to this batch at a later date as explained further  on  in  this
manual.


Enter Manual Tag

[pic]

Sheep lose tags and in some cases tags can be defective and  not  read.   If
this happens you can enter the ear tag  number  manually  –  it  has  to  be
exactly as it appears on the tag without any spaces.  For Example:

      UK024422000445

Tags are entered through an input form as per the screenshot below:

[pic]

[pic]:

Download from Reader

The third method downloads data from the stick readers memory into the  form
populating the lower half of it as if it was coming in  from  the  scanning.
Click on the Download from Reader button and you will be presented with  the
following screenshot – the blue light should illuminate on the reader:

[pic]

If you agree with the numbers then click on Yes.  If not  clock  on  No  and
start again.
If you click on yes the tags will populate the form as follows:

[pic]

You will then be asked if you want to clear the reader.  If all of the  tags
have come in and the numbers tally click yes.  This will  clear  the  memory
of the reader.

[pic]

NB:  If you do not clear the sticks memory the  tags  that  have  just  been
downloaded will be downloaded again – this is especially  important  if  you
have opened another collection as the system does not check  for  duplicates
in closed collections.


Batch Download


The EID stick can be set to store tags on the stick in groups\batches.  Scan
the first batch and it is saved as group A. Turn  the  stick  off.  Turn  it
back on and hold the green button down and read the menu, when it  says  add
group? Let go of the green button this increments the group to B. For  C  do
the same thing as B, turn stick off & follow same process.

[pic]
Double click the rows to allocate  a  batch  number  to  each  group.  Click
update 2 save[pic]


Add Animal To Batch

[pic]

This option can be used to allocate sheep not in batches or sheep  that  you
want to change batch numbers and that are already scanned onto the EAC  into
the batch ready for moving off the EAC.

[pic]

The user can double click the row in the grid to select a current batch  and
add more sheep to it. Or double click the new batch row  and  give  the  new
batch a description (normally the location they are being  sent)  and  click
the save button. There must be  a  batch  number  showing  before  the  save
button is clicked.

[pic]

[pic]

The user is asked to check that the blue light on the EID stick in on.  This
indicates that there is a live and working  blue  tooth  connection  between
the stick and laptop. If the user clicks the No  button  they  will  not  be
able to scan eartags and will see the following warning message.

[pic]

If they click yes, begin to scan and see the grid details filled in.

[pic]


Send Movement On to EAC to Aphis

[pic]

[pic]

Click File and Send animals to Aphis. This will  update  the  sheep  on  the
permit to Aphis as being on the collection.  This  is  how  Aphis  know  the
sheep have been moved onto the EAC. Note Aphis  will  not  accept  the  same
permit being sent more than once. You must send all the sheep on one  permit
in one hit.

You can use the check Unconfirmed documents option to see what docs and  how
many sheep there should be on them to check the number  that  should  be  on
the document.


Animals with issues

If tags have problems with them Aphis will let you know which tags have a
problem and what the problem is. You can move tags in from the correct
flock and different F Doc if they are showing as on another flock. Or
delete them from the EAC.

[pic]


View Animals In Collection

[pic]

The animals can be viewed by batch. You see how many sheep you have  in  any
given batch. Or you can view all. There is also an  option  to  view  closed
collections.

[pic]

Double click a batch to view the individual sheep that make up the batch.

[pic]

These details can be printed out, or exported to a csv file (which  will  be
readable in Excel), or sent to Aphis by clicking the  File  menu  option  in
the top left of the screen.

[pic]

Send Details to Aphis will allow the sheep to be recorded onto  Aphis.  This
option needs to be done before  sheep  leave  the  EAC.  Once  the  vet  has
checked the sheep and confirm all are ok to go you send the batch  to  Aphis
and this takes the sheep off the EAC.

[pic]


Find Tags

[pic]

When drilled down to detailed tag list there is a Find option  available  in
the File menu. Click it to load find form. Enter any part  of  the  tag  and
click find next.

[pic]

The first tag with a match will be highlighted.

[pic]

If it isn’t the tag you are looking for click find next again.


Record Dead Animals

[pic]

 This option allows dead anials to be read or  entered  manually  to  record
them as Dead.  The function of  recording  is  the  same  throughout  but  a
slightly different screen will be displayed.  We have shown a  manual  input
screen but the system works the same as the other inputs – you can scan  the
tags also:
[pic]

When viewed in menu option 4 you will see that they  are  recorded  as  DEAD
and that the original batch they were in will be the number  of  sheep  less
that you recorded.
[pic]


Move Non Exportable Animals Off EAC

[pic]

Option 7 works similarly to Option 6.  This option should be  used  to  move
animals off the collection centre that are no longer going to  be  exported:
For Example – You want to keep the  aniamls  and  put  them  into  your  own
flock.  When selected the following screen will be displayed:

[pic]

[pic]

The flock mark is the flock mark you are moving the animlas  to.   The  date
is the date you move them and this data will populate the  movement  license
and you can print copies as required:

[pic]
[pic]
A My Flock button has been added. Click to populate your flock and EAC  name
and address details.


Close Current Collection

[pic]

[pic]

It is a good idea to click Yes and check with Aphis that they have  no  more
sheep showing on the collection.
[pic]
[pic]

[pic]

[pic]

When all sheep have gone from a collection and you want to close it, so  you
can start a new one, click the ok button.

[pic]



[pic]

When selected the following screenshot  will  be  presented  –  this  option
should not be used unless instructed to do so by Newline Staff:

[pic]


All it does is downloads the latest sheep breeds, ages and  types  of  trade
descriptions that Aphis have stored on their database.






View System Settings

[pic]


This section should not be used  unless  instructed  to  do  so  by  Newline
staff. It has user names and password to access Aphis.


Initial setup to link the EID stick to the EAC Software.


The EAC software works with a variety of readers.  The one  currently  being
used is the Shearwell stick.  It has already been setup and  these  settings
should not be changed unless instructed to do so  by  a  member  of  Newline
staff.  The settings are accessed through the Move onto EAC  main  form  and
they are displayed below.

Shearwell Stick Reader Menu Functions


Please follow the following  instructions  in  order  to  erase  the  Eartag
numbers on a Shearwell stick that has memory enabled.

      •     Power on the stick by pressing the green button, but continue to
           hold your finger on the button. This  will  take  you  into  the
           stick menu.
      •     On the stick display you will see the following screen messages.
      •     “Hold For Menu”
      •     “New Group?”
      •     “Erase All Tags?” At this point let go of the green button.
      •     You then get a screen asking  “Are  You  Sure?”   It  also  says
           “Press To Erase” (with a countdown from 5).
      •     Within the 5 second countdown, press the green button  to  erase
all tags.

If you had continued holding the green button past the  5  second  countdown
to erase the tags, the following screens appear;

      •     “Erase Last Grp?” If you let go of  the  green  button  at  this
           point you again get the “Are You Sure?” “Press To Erase” (with a
           countdown from 5), again.
      •     “Rapid Read On?” or “Rapid Read Off?” Depending on whether rapid
           read is disabled or enabled.
      •     “Disable Memory?”
      •     “Cancel”

If you disable the memory you  will  get  the  following  screens  when  you
switch on the stick and continue to hold the green button.

      •     “Hold For Menu”
      •     “Enable Memory?”
      •     “Rapid Read On?”
      •     “Cancel”

It is important to note however, if at  any  point  you  release  the  green
button you will activate or deactivate whatever command  screen  you  happen
to be in at that point in time and you can begin scanning.

In order to safely exit the stick menu  without  making  changes,  keep  the
green button pressed until the “Cancel” screen  appears,  then  release  the
green button!

If you release the button at the wrong time, then you need to power off  the
stick and start the process again.

 View Flock List Report



The flock list provides a list of sheep that  Aphis  have  recorded  against
the current / open collection as being on the collection. To view the  flock
list either go into menu option 4 or 5 and click the View menu  in  the  top
left of the screen.

[pic]

If Aphis have no sheep registered on the current collection  this  could  be
that you have not sent any onto Aphis because  you’ve  only  just  opened  a
collection, or you’ve exported all the sheep off  the  collection.  In  that
case you will get a message.

[pic]


Unconfirmed Documents Report

This report shows all the gdoc that Aphis have been told are coming  to  the
EAC. It shows the document date, from flock, document number and  number  of
heads. You can use this to check that the permit you are  sending  to  Aphis
has the correct number of sheep on it. It is found on the same menu  as  the
flock list report.

[pic]


Rejected Animals Report

Aphis will reject animals if they are on standstill, have residency issues
or lost and replaced tag issues. There is a report to show which animals
are rejected and why they have been rejected.

[pic]


History \ Closed Collections Report

You can view closed collections and animals details, and produce printouts.

Basic Premise

All sheep scanned into the EAC software need to be sent in  to  Aphis.  This
is option 4 Send Movement on to EAC to Aphis. The Flock list menu option  in
view animals in collection confirms which sheep Aphis know are on  the  EAC.
Once the vet has checked the sheep and confirmed the  batches  are  fit  for
export you send the batch to  Aphis.  This  moves  the  sheep  off  the  EAC
according to Aphis. The flock list option can be used to  confirm  what  are
still on the EAC. If it is 0 everything has been moved. If the vet finds  an
issue with sheep and you are not allowed to export them, you can use  option
7 move non exportable animals off EAC. This option can be used  to  put  the
sheep back in the EAC owners own flock or in  another  persons  flock.  They
enter the details and print a permit to suit and the  details  are  recorded
on Aphis.
 


A new collection can be open for 7 days only. You start with 0 sheep in  the
EAC you can put through as many as you have and end the collection  with  0.
Do NOT close the collection if the EAC flock list option does not show 0.
