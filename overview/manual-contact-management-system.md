                          Contact Management System
                     (part of the LAMS software system)


                                    [pic]



                  Initial Draft of this Manual: 10/06/2004
  First, to start using the contact management system, you need to go into
    option 10 on the Utility Menu (that’s option 4 from the main screen)

                                    [pic]

 This will take you to the initial screen, where we can start to set up the
                          details of this contact.

                                    [pic]
     First, we can choose who is entering/creating this contact.  In our
               example, we will pick Rep No 106, M Macintosh.

         Now we pick the type of contact that we are going to make….

                                    [pic]

 (If you need to add another contact type, click the small New button to the
  right;  this will take you to a form where you can create another type of
                                  contact.)





     Now to choose the rep that is actually going to make this contact.

    Once we have chosen the contact’s creator, the contact’s type and the
   contact’s rep, then we can start to enter a description of the contact
 itself.  In this example, we have entered the description “Emailed Reports
                               to local Paper”



                                    [pic]

 If the contact involves a document, then you can store a copy of this away
  with the contact details.  To attach a file to the contact, click on the
  Document? checkbox.  This will display a text-box to enter a filename in,
                 and a button to browse for a file instead.

                                    [pic]

  If you click on the Browse button, this will bring up a dialog box, where
                      you can select a file to attach.

                                    [pic]

 Once we have chosen the relevant document, the screen look something like…
                                    [pic]


 Now we have the details of the actual contact itself, we can also choose if
   this contact needs to be followed up.  If so, then check the Follow Up?
                 check box.  This will show some new fields.

                                    [pic]

 First, set a date that you want the follow up to be done by.  Then, select
                   a rep to assign the follow-up task to.

                                    [pic]

               Enter any notes to go with the follow-up task.

                                    [pic]
               So, the screen should look something like this.

                                    [pic]

 Once all the details are correct, click the Generate Contact button.  This
   will store away the details of the contact, and then take you on to the
 second stage, where you can choose the customer/customers that this contact
                                 relates to.
                                    [pic]

  There are the basic details of the contact up in the top-right.  Use this
 screen like the normal customer search options.  Once you actually choose a
                   customer, you will be asked to confirm.

                                    [pic]

  Click No to go back and choose again, or Yes to create the contact.  Once
                this is done, you will get a Success message.

                                    [pic]

   and then you will be taken back to choose another customer, or you can
                       finish and quit by pressing F8.
