Buyers

Buyers in NAS are customers that have bought lots that the auctioneer has offered for sale.

Buyer Details

The buyer details grouping shows users the options to select from the sale day menu if they intend to do a task that involves buyers.

Buyer Registration

Some firms use a permanent buyer number system. Buyers register and are given permanent numeric buyer numbers. They may print these on special credit card style printers and hold them up at the point of sale. Permanent buyer numbers are set up outside of the sale in customer edit. Some firms may use temporary buyer numbers and allocate different buyers different numbers for each sale. This can be done in the buyer registration option.

Search for the buyer and add a temporary buyer number on their account for the sale.

In the example above the temporary buyer number is 55.

More often than not this type of system would be used at a furniture sale, general sale, specialist sale, implement sale rather than a livestock sale.

List of registered buyers

The list of registered buyers shows all buyers that have been registered at the sale or that have a permanent buyer number.

Buyer invoices

Within a sale the buyer invoices show which lots have been bought by which buyers. In this screen the user may see what the lot made and what the buyer owes for purchasing the items.

When menu option 17. Buyer Invoices is selected the user is prompted to enter the buyer name or number.

There are a number of different methods available to find buyers in the sale at this point.

By name

Type the buyer surname or business name and press the enter key. A list of names of buyers in the sale that match will be displayed for the user to choose the correct one. If there is only one the buyer invoice screen will load.

By surname letter

If you remember the buyers name begins with a P you may just enter P and press the enter key and all the buyers that begin with P will be displayed in the result list.

By account number

If you know the account number you may type it in and press the enter key to load the buyer invoice for this account.

By viewing all buyers in the sale

Press the enter key at this point to view all buyers on the day.

By temporary name

Some auctions wish to sell lots to a temporary or casual account. NAS allows this functionality and the buyers invoice may be found using the temporary name.

Typing in ROK and pressing the enter key brings back all the temporary accounts used for Rok on the day.

Detail Screen

Lot details

The buyer invoice screen shows the buyer name and address in the top left hand side (the address is blank on temporary accounts). The sections the buyer has bought in the top right hand side. In this example the buyer has bought in the cattle section. The lot number is shown in the lot column and the quantity in the lot is shown in the hds column. The colour can be seen in the breed column. The description provides a description of the item for sale. Weight is shown in the Wt column.  The individual price per head in the price column and the total price in the total column.

Charges

The gross total shows the combined total of the hammer price multiplied by the quantity. Various charges may be added or deducted from the gross price to leave the net total that is due to be paid by the buyer. There are no buyer charges shown in the example above.

Averages

A count of heads in the section is provided with an average weight and average price per unit and per head.

Action

The user may decide what action to take by selecting one of the choices from the action frame.

[I] Invoice

The user may type an I and press the enter key or if they prefer using the mouse they may click the [I] Invoice label.

They will then see the Invoice action frame and be able to make their next choice.

[D]Deductions

If the user has further charges to take from or add to the buyer invoice total the user types D and presses the enter key.

The Amend Deductions form will load. The user will see a list of charges \ deductions \ additions (this list is user configurable to suit company requirements). The user may type in the charge number they require or double click the charge description from the charge grid.

The user sets the amount using a minus sign if they wish to reduce the amount from the buyer invoice and a plus sign if they wish to increase the buyers invoice total.

If the user does not use minus or plus the system warns them they must do so.

The user should adjust the charge amount putting the appropriate sign at the front of the amount and press the enter key to apply the charge.

This changes the value in the charge grid.

Click the F5 button to save this charge.

NB: The charge is shown in the charges grid. An ! mark indicates a manual charge has been made by a NAS user.

A movement form may be shown for livestock items to record which premises the items are moving to. This may be a government requirement in certain countries.

[Q] Paid by chq

If the buyer wishes to pay todays debt only for the full amount by cheque the user may select this option to process the payment quickly without needing to go through the payments form.

[C] Contra

If the buyer has sold as well as bought they may be owed money. This can be contra’d from the money they owe you as a buyer. The contra option is red to draw your attention to the fact it is there and you can do it. It does not show if there is not a value on both seller and buyer side.

The option shows the user what the seller amount is. See cheque net amount 63107.19 and what the invoice amount is. It suggests what to contra. If you wish to proceed on this basis click the F5 – Save button.

[U] Unpaid

This option gives the buyer credit. They are not going to pay for the lots before they take them away. The debt will be posted to the sale ledger upon sale close or running the sales ledger update option.

NB: When an invoice is produced a flag indicates which lots have been invoiced. It is possible for a buyer to have several invoices and to not have all lots invoiced at the same time.

The I? column will show an I against lots that have been invoiced. These lots cannot be transferred to an alternative buyer or the values on them changed whilst the lot status is I for invoiced. Should they need to be amended the invoice must be cancelled to remove the I status.

This will produce a passout with lot number and item description which when shown to the yards man allows the buyer to take away their items.

Options Menu

Display Sort Option

If this option is ticked a pop up message will appear for the user to select the sort option each time they select print. This option is normally not required as the auction firm often sets their default preference and leaves it as that. A few auctions have different clients wanting different sort orders and therefore find it useful to prompt at the point of printing.

See sort lot by for more details below.

Sort Lots By

The user may be asked by the buyer to print out the buyer invoice or buyer list in a particular order. Some may prefer the printout to be numerical others may want it in the order of sale (e.g. when a pool \ draw is taken and the sale does not start from lot number 1 and flow sequentially but instead may start at any number and the lot order jump about).

Do not sort lots

The lots will print out in the order they were sold in the ring or pen.

By Lot No

Print paid detail

This option adds payment method details to the printout. See the PAID Cheque line above. In the example the buyer has part-paid today’s debt. Clearing 2000.00 from the total they owe.

If the print paid detail is not ticked it still shows as paid but not the method by which it was paid. See below.

Simple payments

If this option is ticked the user does not have a choice what or how a debt is paid. The [P] Paid options simply takes all of today’s debt as a cheque payment.
