Market System icon (see Market System Icon  figure).  The  first  menu  that
appears is the MARKET & UTILITY MENU as shown below in the Multi <1>  Market
& Utility Menu figure  2(this  menu  may  vary  slightly  depending  on  the
structure of auction firm, i.e. whether it  has  more  than  one  site,  and
whether the user is on the server or a workstation computer. Figure 2  shows
the server version of this menu:

MARKET & UTILITY MENU EXPLAINED IN DETAIL



CREATE MARKET FOR TRANSFER


This option is for auction firms that have more than one market day  a  week
or more than one market  site.  I  find  it  helps  people  understand  this
process a little better when I explain in simple  every  day  terms  without
computer jargon what it is all about. The Newline ASP set up always has  one
computer that acts as a Server, in simple terms  this  means  that  all  the
information is stored on that computer.  The  server  computer  has  a  hard
drive (I know I said no jargon, but don’t close  the  manual  just  yet)  in
simple terms a hard drive is exactly the same as any filing cabinet in  your
office. A filing cabinet might have  three  shelves  in  it,  and  similarly
Newline ASP divide the hard drive into 3 partitions, called the C  drive,  D
drive and E drive. In effect 3 shelves within a filing cabinet. The  purpose
of have 3 shelves is to make it easier to find what you are looking for,  it
keeps it neat, and it is the same with hard drive partitions. On a shelf  in
the filing cabinet in your office you can store  folders,  this  is  exactly
the same for each drive in a  computer.  Different  folders  are  stored  in
different places. Folders in computer terms can also be called  directories.
Within folders you can store files. The market system uses a  folder  called
MARKET to store the main debt and database files. This MARKET folder is  the
main or master folder/directory. When auction firms have more than one  sale
a week or more than one market site Newline will set  up  several  different
folders so that the firm can run different sales during  the  week.  Usually
Newline ASP set up folders called MON for  Monday  sales,  TUE  for  Tuesday
sales, WED for Wednesday sales, THUR  for  Thursday,  OTM  for  Over  Thirty
Months and so on. These folders can be stored on any of  the  shelves/drives
in on the Server computer. So far so good I hope.

The Market folder has the master/main database in  it,  but  all  the  other
folders also have database files in  them.  During  a  Wednesday  sale  your
staff will be entering lots, selling lots, producing cheques and  so  on  in
the folder called WED. This folder is completely separate to  MARKET.  If  a
new vendor or purchaser is added to the database in WED at  midday  (or  any
time during the day), it is not added to any other folder  automatically  at
that moment in time. Therefore if Mr. Williams was  your  last  customer  in
the W’s with a number of W150 and a new customer called Mr. Willis is  added
the new customer is given a temporary number of W151  (the  next  sequential
number in the WED folders database. However this customer is  not  added  to
any other folder at this point. Therefore if another member  of  your  staff
is working in the OTM folder on Wednesday he will not  find  Mr.  Willis  in
there. This may seem like a problem, but I shall explain all. When  you  run
the end of market routines and close the sale down in the WED  folder  (that
is option 16 End of Market Reports, in the After  Sale  Menu)  all  the  new
customers who bought or sold are automatically added to  the  main  database
in the MARKET folder, any new customers who did  not  buy  or  sell  can  be
added to the main folder by answering Y (yes) when prompted to add  customer
to Master file. These End of Market Reports also update  all  the  debts  to
the main MARKET folder. It is at this point when temporary customer  numbers
become permanent.





 Example:

Devon Auctions have a market on Tuesday & Friday, and they  do  Over  Thirty
Month cattle also. They are set up with the  following  folders/directories:
TUE, FRI, OTM & MARKET. MARKET is the main folder with the debts and  master
database in it.


CREATE MARKETS EXAMPLE.


Before the Tuesday market  starts  one  member  of  staff  needs  to  CREATE
MARKETS FOR TRANSFER, this option might only be available on the  Server  PC
(personal computer) in the Multi <1> Market & Utility Menu as shown below.

[pic]

The user is prompted which market it is they wish to update,  CHOOSE  MARKET
NAME TO UPDATE READY FOR TRANSFER? In this case the  user  wants  to  update
the Tuesday market so they type TUE and  press  the  Enter/return  key.  The
computer will search for the folder to update and  tell  the  user  when  it
finds it, and where it is. THE MARKET YOU REQUIRE IS ON  THE  C:  DRIVE  (or
whatever drive it happens to be stored on). The next  step  is  vital,  make
sure that no body else is using the market  system,  they  should  not  even
have one of the market system menus on  their  screen.  As  it  says  IT  IS
***IMPERATIVE*** THAT NO OTHER ROUTINE IS IN  PROGRESS  DURING  COPY  ENSURE
THAT NO OTHER WORK IS IN PROGRESS AND TYPE {GO} AND [RETURN]?

[pic]

The system copies all  the  latest  debts  and  customers  from  the  MARKET
folder, into and over the existing files in the TUE folder. If another  menu
of staff is in the system the information may not  be  copied  properly  and
there may be problems trying  to  run  the  market.  When  this  process  is
complete you will see the following menu.

[pic]

If you are an auction updating a sale to run locally (i.e.  in  your  office
as oppose to a remote site) type [B] and press the Enter key  to  return  to
the Multi menu.

At the end of the Tuesday sale closing the sale down by  doing  the  End  of
Market Reports in the After Sale Menu will copy all the  new  customers  and
update the central debts (sales ledger) in the  MARKET  folder.  Some  firms
may wish to keep the sale open for a day or two in case any  problems  arise
during the next couple of days.  This is  fine,  however  it  can  be  worth
closing the sale down, before your next market so that  new  customers  will
be updated into the main MARKET folder and subsequently copied out into  the
FRI when the user does CREATE MARKETS FOR TRANSFER? FRI.

* NOTE * Getting the sequence  out  of  order  will  cause  frustration  and
problems. E.G. If you load 10 new customers into  the  OTM  folder  (or  any
folder) before doing CREATE MARKETS FOR TRANSFER  and then  do  it,  the  10
customers will be over written by  what  ever  was  in  the  central  MARKET
folder database.



REMOTE SITES


All auction firms have special  requirements,  logistical  differences,  and
varying histories, so there are a number  of  different  methods  of  moving
market data back and forth to them. A brief list of  the  different  methods
includes:

   1. Floppy disk
   2. Tape Drive
   3. Removable hard drive
   4. Multilink via modems
   5. Laptop
   6. PcAnywhere via modems
   7. ISDN

The first four in the list where used a great deal in  years  gone  by,  but
have been super ceded by modern technologies.


                 FLOPPY DISK TRANSFER

For clients using the floppy disk option put a floppy  disk  in  the  floppy
disk drive, type D and press enter. A file is then created and  copied  onto
the floppy disk. Take the disk with you to  the  remote  site  and  run  the
Receive Central Market Data option. The remote site  will  then  be  updated
ready to run the market.


                 TAPE DRIVE TRANSFER

Set up by Newline ASP to run of icons on the desktop.


                 REMOVABLE HARD DRIVE TRANSFER

Set up by Newline ASP to run of icons on the desktop.


                 MULTILINK MODEM TRANSFER

This is an old modem technology used with windows 3.11. Select  M  from  the
menu option. This creates a download.zip file that is  then  transferred  to
the remote site.


                 LAPTOP TRANSFER

Some sites have remote sales using mobile laptop solutions. These sales  are
set up and transferred by icons on the desktop created by Newline ASP.


                 PcANYWHERE MODEM TRANSFER

Select the M for modem option and a download.zip  file  is  created  in  the
download folder. Using pcAnywhere’s file transfer program copy  download.zip
from the local download folder to the remote download folder  and  then  run
the Receive Central Market Data option.


                 ISDN TRANSFER

Transfer using icons created by Newline ASP.


REMOTE – MARKET & UTILITY MENU


[pic]


The user at the remote site must receive the file that has been  created  in
whatever way by the central market staff, by running  the  Receive  Central-
Market Data option in their Remote – Market & Utility Menu. Note  each  site
is set up by Newline ASP with  the  appropriate  menu  for  them.  Once  the
computer has been updated at the remote sale the market can commence.


CREATE DATA FOR RETURN TO CENTRAL MARKET


When the market is over and balanced the information need to be copied  back
to the central site by using the Create Data for return  to  Central  Market
option.


RECEIVE RETURNING DATA FROM MARKETS


[pic]

At the central site the data is received and the process completed by  using
the Receive Returning Data from Markets option.



RUN A MARKET


On entering this option the user is prompted for  the  name  of  the  market
required. Type the name and press the Enter key[1]


Figure 5: Run a Market

[pic]

The software will then search  through  all  the  drives  attached  to  your
computer for a market with that name. When it finds it, the system will  ask
for confirmation that it is the correct market. If it is press  C  in  upper
case. LAMS uses upper case  text  throughout  so  at  this  point  it  is  a
reminder to put on the Caps Lock.
Once you have confirmed the market name you  are  presented  with  the  MAIN
MENU.

RUN A MARKET


MAIN MENU


On entering the MAIN MENU the following screen is displayed showing all  the
options needed to run a market;

This screen allows the user to select one of the options by  typing  in  the
required number and pressing <Return>. Each section has its own chapter.
This screen also shows the market name, the market date and the market  week
number. At the bottom of the screen is a box  showing  how  many  lots  have
been entered during this market. If you are starting a new market then  this
number must be set to zero. This is done by choosing  option  6:  SETUP  NEW
SALE

SETUP NEW SALE


Does exactly what it implies. It will clear all the lots from  the  previous

details are complete, press the “TAB” key to save. The account  will  assume
the next sequential number on the database. E.g. if the  last  customer  the
user entered in the W'’ was John Williams and his customer number was  W250,
the next time the user entered a customer in the W’s,  that  customer  would
be allocated customer number W251.

Yes can be selected by moving the  arrow  keys  from  left  to  right,  when
details have been completed the operator can delegate the  number  allocated
to account.[3] This option is used to allocate numbers from  1  to  100  for
the markets biggest most regular customers. N.B. It  is  important  to  know
which numbers the user allocates, because it is possible to overwrite  these
customers if the same number is chosen again.

LOT DETAILS



6. PRE-BOOK LOTS


This option enables market operators to Pre-Book lots prior to the sale  and
prior to producing sale sheets. This  helps  to  speed  up  the  process  of
completing sold lots as less information is typed in during the live sale.


Figure 24: Print Out Sale Sheets when Prebooking [Y/N]

[pic]

Select Y and press the Enter key if you want to print out sale  sheets  when
loading the lots, or N if you do not. The choice is yours but  most  markets
do not print these details out, they can however be useful as  an  audit  in
paperless markets. The print out will provide the vendors number  and  name,
the lot number, number of heads, breed, animal type and weight if  all  this
information is entered by the computer operator.  This  is  printed  out  on
plain paper.

The batch file question  is  relevant  to  customers  using  the  Sale  Ring
software and, or customers running Digital Sales. If  you  do  not  use  the
sale ring or digital sale software the answer  should  be  N,  for  no.  The
batch file prompt should only be Y if the animals are sold  individually  or
if the user is entering  the  lots  immediately  before  they  go  into  the
salering and the animals are not numbered with  different  lot  numbers.  If
they are using the batching software then they MUST  NOT  say  yes  to  this
option.

The catalogue question produces a file in the folder specified by the  user.
This file can then be imported into word, and a catalogue produced.


Type F and press the Enter key for Fat animals or  S  and  press  Enter  for
Store animals, depending  on  whether  you  are  pre-booking  fat  or  store
animals, if neither select store as less questions are asked.

Select the Statement Section you require by typing the number on  the  left-
hand side of the Animal Type and pressing the Enter  key.  You  will  notice
this place a tick by the Animal Type you have chosen. Press Enter  again  to
continue (see Figure).



Figure 25: Select Animal Type to Pre-Book

[pic]




The user is prompted to enter the  vendor  name  and  number.  The  user  is
prompted for holding number and  farm  assurance  number  if  they  are  not
already in the customers account. This option has been added to  the  system
to save users time. At this point you may enter these details  if  you  have
them, or press the Enter  key  to  continue.  The  user  may  also  enter  a
different date if the animals have been in lairage before the sale date,  or
just press return to accept the current market date.

The user is prompted to enter the BCMS movement type if it  is  relevant  to
the stock section and it is set up in the installation menu to do  this.  To
comply with F&M market requirements  there  are  a  number  of  new  choices
offered when booking in cattle.

Enter P for Private Sale Transactions
Enter M for normal Market Sales
L for cattle sold at market but go into Lairage first
O for cattle sold through a market that have come out of lairage.

The user is also able to enter a fieldsman number. You do not have to  enter
a number, but if you do it can  be  used  at  a  latter  date  for  analysis
reports in the Utilities Menu. It can be handy for deadweight sales.

      STORE STOCK


When prompted to enter fat or store, enter S to enter store stock. The  user
is not prompted to enter a class code or origin if S is selected  for  store
stock. Instead an animal type box will appear and the user must  select  the
animal type to prebook. To prebook store steers in  the  example  below  the
user would enter a 1 in the Enter Type field.


Figure 28: Store Stock Type Selection

[pic]





      LOT NUMBERS

      Multiple lots can be entered into the system eg. lot number 50/51 this
      will enable the user to input two animals at  once,  see  Pre  Booking
      Multiple Lots figure. Equally the lot number could be input  as  50/52
      thus inputting three animals, the only  stipulation  to  multiple  lot
      entry is the lot numbers must be  sequential.  Bar  code  readers  are
      almost essential items as they rule out operator error.  The bar  code
      reader can input ear number, date of birth and breed all in one swipe,
      these fields are input electronically by scanning the  bottom  barcode
      on the new style passports, but  can  be  manually  or  electronically
      amended. Lots that have  been  entered  together  can  still  be  sold
      individually, alternatively lots entered individually can be sold as a
      group lot, whichever way lots are entered or  sold,  they  will  still
      appear on invoices and cheques as individual transactions.

Figure 29: Pre Booking Multiple Lots

[pic]



      BARCODE READERS


      Barcode readers are common place  tools  in  the  majority  of  market
      offices nowadays and make the task of  lot  loading  far  easier.  The
      barcode on the bottom of the new style passports contains  the  eartag
      number, date of birth and breed of an animal, and by  scanning  it  at
      the eartag prompt this will be booked into the computer automatically.



      EARTAG FIELD

      For users that do not use barcode readers if herd numbers are held  on
      vendors account, for every lot that attracts an ear number, this  herd
      number will appear automatically, only the tag number is then required
      e.g. 00023. If the animal concerned does not have the same herd number
      as stored on account, type ear number in full  at  tag  reference  and
      this will over type existing herd number for that lot.



      BREED

      For users that do not use barcode readers  the  breeds  available  are
      shown at the top of the input screen. Pick the number required next to
      the breed to be input. In the top right of the screen the user can see
      how many pages of breeds there are. Pressing F1 will  show  the  other
      pages.



Figure 30: Breeds

      [pic]


HINT !
      In lot input if a mistake is made the  operator  can  select  “+”  and
      press enter this will revert back to the previous prompt.
      On completion of each lot the option to continue amend  or  reject  is
      offered,


Fast & easy lot amending

Amending lot details is easy. A plus sign ‘+’ may be used  to  step  back  a
level at any point. E.G. if the user has mistyped the  lot  number  and  the
cursor is flashing down at the Enter type line, entering a ‘+’ and  pressing
the Enter key will place the cursor back at the  lot  number  line.  Another
fast editing technique is included in this release by the  line  numbers  on
the left hand side of the screen. When prompted Line to Amend 1-9, the  user
enters the number of the line they want to amend and presses the Enter  key.
They can then make the amendment to the chosen field.


Figure 31: Amend Lot Details

[pic]


      F8 ESCAPE


      The F8 key can be used to escape from more menus than ever before.  F8
      will take users out of the Enter Lots During the Sale option,  out  of
      the During the Sale menu, out of Sale Sheet call through  and  out  of
      the Pre-booking options.


      Lot number will automatically be default to next, return  if  this  is
      correct or type in correct number, sub lots may be created A-J.




7. PRINT SALE SHEETS


In this menu the user may print sale sheets for any section from a lot to  a
lot, or look at unprinted lots in selected sections.  Option  3.  Return  to
pre-book takes user back to pre-book menu, if this  is  not  required  press
return for main menu.


Figure 32: Print Sales Sheets

[pic]



8. SELL PRE-ENTERED LOTS


Option 6 to pre-book lots must be completed before this  menu  is  selected,
it is a finishing off process, weight, price and purchaser can be input.  At
this  stage  when  searching  for  buyer’s  account  reference  any  account
previously used in the current market will be highlighted by an  *.  Certain
question prompts are asked because all auction firms  have  different  needs
and practices, even within their own organisations and different sale  days.
The questions are explained in detail below. The user should answer them  as
desired:


Figure 33: Terminal in Sale Ring with Display Board

[pic]





      TERMINAL IN SALERING

      Some auction firms have laptops or small computers in  the  sale  ring
      that are used to enter the price, weight & purchaser directly into the
      computer system as the sale is happening live.  This  means  that  the
      information is ready for the purchaser when they go to  collect  their
      bills from the office.  There  is  no  duplication  of  entering  this
      information from sale sheets back in the main office and no time delay
      because no sale sheets are needed.


      DISPLAY BOARDS

      Auction firms that sell in the ring straight onto the market  computer
      system can run display boards off the laptops. Fat Cattle, & fat sheep
      can be displayed on the display boards  using  the  LAMS  system,  but
      Newline ASP have another product that deals with  store  cattle  sales
      called Salering 2000.



      NO TERMAINAL IN THE SALERING

      If the auction firm do not have a computer in the sale ring  then  the
      user must answer no to  that  question.  Firms  that  do  not  have  a
      computer in the salering run sale sheets back to the office and  enter
      information from these  sheets  into  the  computers  in  the  office.
      Although this works it does involve duplication of information  and  a
      time delay between the sale happening live in the ring  and  the  sale
      sheet being input in the office.


Figure 34: Terminal Not in Sale Ring

[pic]





      AUTOMATICALLY CREATE SUB LOTS

      This is a useful option especially during the busy sheep sales.  Stock
      may be pre booked either from a catalogue or entry sheets, even though
      the operator may not know the actual order or quantities of  stock  to
      be sold.  For example, if a lot was entered with  a  quantity  of  one
      hundred, the vendor then decided just to sell ten in the first lot,  a
      first sub lot would then exist with ninety  unsold.   This  lot  would
      have the numeric number of the original lot, “A, B, C” lots would then
      be created until all the entered quantity was allocated


      SELL MULTIPLE LOTS

       If this option is selected lots that are entered in the system may be
      selected as a batch by inputting “/” e.g. 50/51 would sell lots  fifty
      to fifty one in one transaction.



      COMPLETE PRE BOOKED LOTS

      When the user has answered the questions to determine  how  and  where
      they sell certain animal types, they can then simply complete the  lot
      transaction, i.e. enter weight (if needed), price and purchaser.


Figure 35: Selling Pre Booked Lots

[pic]





      9.ENTER LOTS DURING SALE


Is a “start to finish routine” vendor to purchaser in  one  transaction,  if
lots have not been previously loaded this is where to input them,  the  same
rules apply as previously described in 6 Prebook lots and 8  Sell  Prebooked
Lots.



10. LOT EDIT/SEARCH


In this option the user can search on an ear number or lot number. Input  an
eartag either in full or herd number only, this  creates  a  search  on  all
lots and produces a detailed on screen list of all lots bearing a  reference
to the tag. Enter a lot number and the search  will  produce  every  lot  in
each section with the requested number, the user can then  select  the  line
number required and edit the lot.  After a specified lot  has  been  amended
the option to amend another lot or return to menu is offered.



Figure 36: Lot Edit/Search

[pic]


11. LOT DELETION


Lot deletion is selected by Vendor, the lot is displayed in full on  screen,
the user is asked to confirm Y/N to continue and delete the lot.


12. EARTAG ENTRY



      1.INPUT/AMEND EARTAGS

Some Newline ASP users produce skeleton catalogues before  the  sale.  These
auction firms know the vendors that are  entering  animals  into  the  sale.
These  animals  are  prebooked,  but  when  prompted  to  enter  the  eartag
information the user presses the F9 key, this  saves  the  lot  without  any
specific animal data, such as  eartag  number,  DOB  and  so  on.  When  the
animals arrive at market with their paper  work  the  details  can  then  be
scanned in using the input,  amend  eartag  option.  The  user  selects  the
section that the animals have been booked into and  enters  the  lot  number
they have been allocated. Then the rest of the information is  scanned  from
the passport.


Figure 37: Input/Amend Eartags

[pic]





      2. PRINT EARTAGS FOR PURCHASERS

This gives a print out of eartags for selected purchaser,  with  the  option
to print vendor’s details.


PURCHASER DETAILS



13. ENTER NEW PURCHASER


Is exactly the same as enter a new vendor and does  not  create  a  separate
record from that of the vendor in fact brings up exactly the same  file,  it
is not wrong therefore to enter a new customer in either  the  purchaser  or
vendor entry options.


14.PURCHASER EDIT


Vendor or purchaser edit is exactly the same option,  customer  details  can
be amended in either of these edit fields either selection would  amend  the
same file. Refer to vendor edit for (2) detailed analysis of  customer  edit
facility.


15. PURCHASER BILLS/LISTS


Select this option and a sub menu will appear as shown below:


Figure 38: Print Purchase Invoice Menu

[pic]


1.BILLS

If the selected purchaser requires separate bills for specific animal  types
a section should be selected, if all transactions are  to  be  on  the  same
account, return to the section prompt.  At the  purchaser  prompt  the  user
can type:

      PURCHASER FULL NAME this will bring up all purchasers  buying  on  the
      day in that section with that name.

      ACCOUNT NUMBER will select that account and  any  transactions  loaded
      against it.

HINT !
      Typing the first letter of the account number/surname will display all
      buyers with a surname beginning with that letter.

      “+” If this symbol is typed at the purchaser prompt all purchasers  in
      sections selected will be screened in  alphabetical  order,  when  the
      return key is pressed.

a full or part payment option is available, this will then  be  printed  out
on the invoice as an old debt payment. A quit option is  available  in  this
routine if required.  An  option  to  print  cash  received  from  old  debt
payments can be selected in option (6) cancel invoice, option (4) print  old

Answer the questions according to what is needed.


Figure 95: Purchaser Record

[pic]


Figure 96: Purchaser's Payments

[pic]

The user should choose the appropriate code:


Figure 97: Input Payment Amount

[pic]

The computer will print the day book  reflecting  the  payment  and  prompt:
"DIRECT, GENERAL, SPECIAL, PAY-IN-ADV OR CANCEL  D/G/S/P/C"

"Direct" means to post the Payment to a particular Purchase Transaction.  In
order to do this the user must know the record number which can found  using
the "See Purchaser  Record"  routine  or  the  Aged  List  of  Debtors.  The
computer displays the amount available and asks for  the  record  number  to
post to. If after posting payment to a particular purchase  there  is  money
remaining from the Total amount paid,  then  the  computer  returns  to  the
"Direct, General or Cancel" line.

"General" means to allocate the total  payment  to  the  oldest  transaction
first then the next oldest and so on.  It is possible, with one payment,  to
pay off one or more particular purchases that are not the  oldest  and  then
choose  "General for the rest of the money.

"Cancel" means to  remove  all trace  of   the   Payment.  Transaction  from
the Records. This may be necessary  if  half  way  through  posting   it  is
discovered  that  the  Purchase   Transaction.  Record  number   is   wrong.
"Cancel" may not be used after a payment has  already  been  directed  to  a
purchase transaction.

If, after posting to all required  purchase  transactions,  there  is  money
remaining, then the amount is retained in the payment transaction record  as
a negative value. The words

"UNALLOCATED AMOUNT XXX.XX" are printed on the day book. This amount may  be
picked up later by directing a payment of zero to this payment  transaction.
  The amount will then appear as Amount Available and may be directed  to  a
Purchase Transaction.

The final prompt for each payment is:

      "MORE INPUT=(RETURN)KEY   MENU=9"

On choosing 9 for Menu the computer will finalise the  day  book  and  print
the total amount paid.

NOTE
Entering a JOURNAL amount will create a payment transaction as if either   Q
or C had been entered. The amount is entered as a  POSITIVE  figure and  can
be DIRECTED to the incorrect transaction  in the normal way.

NOTE2
If you enter a payment against the wrong purchaser then you   will  need  to
enter a transaction for the same  amount  to  that  incorrect  purchaser  in
order to clear it and correct his balance.


PURCHASERS' ACCOUNT


The usual escape routine is allowed with the prompt:

      "RETURN TO CONTINUE  9 TO ESCAPE"

The computer will prompt:

      "IS THIS FOR ACCOUNTS STAFF OR FOR CUSTOMERS...[A/C]?"

The  computer  produces two different outputs one which   shows   a  balance
on  each transaction for accounts  staff  (A),  and  the  other,  a  simpler
document, to avoid confusing the  customers.   The  actual   format  of  the
customer document can be tailored  to   suit  the  user.   The  user  should
choose appropriately.  If required the program   can  be   made   to   print
a  standard  message  on  all statements and the option  of  a  special  one
for any customer.

The computer will then ask:

      "IS THIS FOR AN AUTORUN OR SINGLE..[A/S]?"

If   the   user  wishes  to   produce,    automatically,    all    Purchaser
Statements  then "A" should be chosen.   If  a  single  or   very   few  are
needed then choose "S".

The  computer  will  offer a chance to  escape  and  then prompt:

      "ENTER CUSTOMER NAME OR NUMBER"

The  user should reply appropriately  and  the  name  and  address   of  the
purchaser will be displayed on screen with a prompt:

      "RETURN TO ACCEPT   9 TO REJECT"

Reply appropriately.

The computer will then prompt:

      SCREEN DISPLAY=(RETURN)  HARD COPY VIA PRINTER=1

Should  the user wish to produce a real statement  then  clearly  he  should
choose  hard copy.   Should he only wish to look   at   the  record,  screen
may be sufficient.

SCREEN - This option is only available  if  "Accounts  Staff"  and  "Single"
have been selected.

The computer will prompt:

      "RECORD NO. TO WORK FROM?"

Depending  on  the  number  of  records  on  disk  the  user  should  choose
appropriately.   The computer will then produce the account  on  screen   in
the  following  order:
Reference (the file record number)
Date
PNO (Payment Transaction file record number)
Comments
Purchases/Cheque
Payment/Sales
Balance  (the  Customer's  Balance at the time  of  the Transaction  -  does
not change)
Transaction  Balance (amount remaining  outstanding  on the  Transaction   -
changes as the Transaction  is cleared)
Finally  on  the last screen for this purchaser it  will  display totals  by
age using headings :-
      CUR xxx  WK1 xxx  WK2 xxx  WK3+ xxx  >>  TOT xxx

where CUR is CURRENT period and WK is WEEK 1/2 or 3 and over.

After  every 20 transactions  displayed,  the  computer stops and prompts:

      "PRESS (RETURN) TO CONTINUE"

to allow a chance for the user to examine the transactions  on  the  screen.
At  the  end  of the display   for  each  customer  the computer prompts:

      "MENU=(RETURN)  MORE=M"

This  offers the chance to continue with  more  purchasers  accounts  or  to
escape to the main purchaser menu.

REMAKE CUSTOMER INDEX

The customer index is a file that provides the Market System  with  a  quick
method of finding customers. When  new  customers  are  added  in  different
markets the index can get out of step and errors may occur with the  message
“Contact Newline immediately.” Remaking the index will  fix  such  problems.
It is good procedure to remake the index every time a  new  sale  is  setup.
Choose Option 1 in the Utility Menu to do this:-


Figure 111: Remake Customer Index

[pic]


Figure 112: Continue with Index Creation

[pic]

Press RETURN or enter the letter to remake the index and  it  will  then  be
remade. It is important to remake the  index  before  every  market  as  new
purchasers from mobile sales etc. will not be included in it. There  is  one
index per logical drive (C: - Z:) as explained in the DOS  section  of  this
manual. Re Indexing takes less than a minute on contemporary  PCs  and  thus
has no particular overhead.


CUSTOMER SORT PRINT

Offers various sorts and printouts as follows:-


Figure 113: Customer Sort

When Newline ASP install a system in a new client site all the  commissions,
tolls, extra deductions, levies, market names, analysis breakdown,  specific
animal types and breeds sold at that market have to  be  set  up.  As  every
market has its own preferences and tends to do things differently  to  other
markets this can  be  a  lengthy  process.  All  of  this  is  done  in  the
Installation Menu, shown in figure 19:

AMEND/PRINT STATEMENT SECTIONS




The Newline ASP LAMS system has 12 statement sections that need  to  be  set
up during the installation. These  are  the  sections  that  are  seen  when
booking animals in. The examples below  can  be  changed  to  suit  specific
company requirements. Within each of these sections are  Animal  Types.  For
instance within Prime Cattle you can  find  Steers,  Heifers  and  Bulls  of
various weight ranges. Within Prime Sheep you could have  Lambs,  Hoggs  and
Sheep. Etc. These Animal Types are represented by Alpha Numeric codes,  such
as F1, L2, H3 and so on.

AMEND AREA CODES



AMEND B*S*E TYPES

Program Ref: BSETYPE

Option 10  -  AMEND  B*S*E  TYPES  will  allow  you  to  change  the  animal
categories included to be printed out on  the  B*S*E declaration  form.  The
categories currently included in the declaration  will  be  displayed  along
with the prompt:-

      ADD NEW SECTION = A    DELETE SECTION = D

Choose as appropriate and enter the type code of the section to be added  or
deleted.


AMEND ANIMAL TYPE SECTIONS


This is a very important option in the installation  menu.  In  this  option
users set up all the descriptions of any animal or item that  will  be  sold
through  the  market  system.  This  option  is  used  to  set  up  standard
commission percentage rates, minimums and maximum rates, MLC levy,  and  all
the prebook options. The system begins with allowing the user to  amend  the
various commission rates for individual types of animal  and  then  proceeds
to allow minimum commission and other alterations.

The computer will display:


Figure 126: A-Z Animal Details

[pic]

There are 26 letters available to enter different Animal Types depending  on
the auction firms specific needs. Each letter has  9  numbers  allocated  to
it. Any firm may create up to 234 different Animal Types. This should  prove
to be plenty for even the busiest market. Enter the  letter  to  be  amended
and press the Enter key. Certain  sections  must  be  allocated  to  certain
items of fat stock. Should the user, for instance, choose F1, the  following
will appear:

"PRESENT VALUES FOR F1 ARE:

ITEM: STEER 380-460    RETURN IF OK ELSE TYPE NEW ITEM"

The E’s and V’s are reserved only for vatable goods.


Figure 127: Animal Details Commission

[pic]

The present value is displayed and the option to type a new one or leave  it
unchanged is given.  For each of these  values,  no  'L'  or   '%'   symbols
should be used.   The Tolls and Levy should be entered as a number of  pence
and the Commission as a percentage.


Figure 128: Min & Max Commission

[pic]


Figure 129: Prebook questions setup


[pic]

The pre-book question set up screen (Enter Animal Details  screen)  is  very
important. This screen enables the user to set up the pre-book  options  and
bill options to match their firms’ requirements.

To make a change the user enter the line number  to  amend.  Inthis  example
the user entered 1 and pressed the Enter key to amend line 1. The user  then
enters Y for yes or N for no to any yes no questions, e.g. Email BCMS? Is  a
yes no question, but WT? Standing for weight is not  that  straight  forward
because different firms work in different ways.


Weight

The user has to make a choice between N, B and A. These  choices  are  shown
along the bottom of the screen. [N] stands for  no  weight,  therefore  when
pre-booking the stock there will be no weight option.  [B]  stands  for  the
weight is available before the sale as the stock is pre-booked.  [A]  stands
for the stock are weighed  but  the  weight  is  only  available  after  the
animals are sold in the sale ring.


Eartag

Is a yes, or no question. If this stock requires  an  eartag  number  to  be
recorded against it the answer must be Y for yes.


Grade

Is a yes, or no question. If this stock requires  a  grade  to  be  recorded
against it the answer must be Y for yes.


Luck

Is a yes, or no question. If this stock requires luck to be recorded
against it the answer must be Y for yes.


No of Heads

Is a yes, or no question. If this stock is sold in lots of more than 1
animal per lot the answer must be Y for yes. If lots are always single
animals the answer should be N for no.


DOB

If you need to record the date of birth the answer must be Y.


CID

If you need to record the CID the answer must be Y.


TOTAL WT

This is the weight that appears on the bill.  A is for average weight. N  is
for total weight/store average. T is normally used for pigs.


PRICE

Stock can be sold per head, enter a H for this, or per kilo, enter a  K  for
this.


SCREEN DISPLAY

You can type in 5 characters here that will appear on the  overhead  display
board if you have one in your sale ring.


Figure 130: Remarks & Breed

[pic]


Repeat Remarks


For certain types of sale it can be useful to  keep  the  remarks  from  the
last lot. For instance in furniture or  implement  sales  the  user  may  be
selling picture frames and want the remarks kept from the last  lot  entered
so it is not necessary to keep typing picture frames over  and  over  again.
This option is set in the Installation Menu, in option 5 Amend  Animal  Type
Settings. Select the letter of the type that  requires  changing  and  press
return. Press return  through  the  commission  screen,  maximum  &  minimum
screen, booking choices screen, until you get to the fourth screen with  the
breed and remarks choices. If repeat remarks is required the user  must  set
the choice to R. There  is  a  white  line  under  the  remarks  field  that
indicates how many characters may be typed in.

Sale” at the Main Menu.  If this is  the  very  first  time  the  user  must
ensure that the appropriate SECTIONS are properly set up and  that  the  LOT
CHECKING AND RANGE has been set up. These options are  found  at  Section  5
INSTALLATION.  The SECTIONS setup is in AMEND MARKET DETAILS  in Section  5.
Then look at section 6.




CHANGE COMMISSIONS, LEVIES, MINIMUMS, ETC.


Choose Minimum Commissions in the installation menu and then work  your  way
through the questions. It is recommended to take advantage of the hard  copy
option at this time.




CHANGE SPECIAL COMMISSION RATES FOR INDIVIUALS.


This may either be done in the  customer  input  or  edit  routines  and  is
described in the “During the Sale” manual. For ease of use the  options  are
repeated again here:-


      COMMISSION OVER RIDES?

This gives you the opportunity to charge certain vendors special  commission
rates. There are three possible  entries  to  this  field.  a)Entering  a  !
followed by an amount will deduct  that amount from the existing  commission
rates for all animal types.   E.g. !1.0 would deduct  1%  from  all  current
commissions. Thus if at Sheep commission was  2.5%  normally  it   would  be
charged at only 1.5% for this vendor.
b)Entering  a * followed by an amount means   to   charge   that  amount  as
commission on all animals                      eg : *2.25 would charge  this
vendor 2.25% on every  animal type he sold at the market.
c)Entering  a % followed by an amount means  to   deduct    this  percentage
amount from his total Commission.    E.g.   %20  would  deduct  20%  of  his
commission. So if a vendors total commission was 100.00  he  would  in  this
case only be charged L80.00.


CHANGE ANIMAL GROUP NAMES(SECTION NAMES).


Choose Amend Market Details in the installation menu  and  use  Amend  Print
Statement Sections.

Choose Customer Sort Print in the Utilities Menu


DOS (DISK OPERATING SYSTEM)


How does the system work?

DOS is probably the most flexible operating system of the 20th  Century  and
allows endless permutations in a network environment.

Basically the early computers had two floppy disk drives for data  storeage.
These were known as the A drive and the B drive.

With the advent of hard drives (offering far greater storage)  the  B  drive
was dropped and the hard drive was known as drive C.

As hard drives became smaller and smaller in size and larger and  larger  in
capacity they were split up into “LOGICAL” drives. These may  be  looked  at
as separate storage areas on the disk and for  ease  of  understanding  they
were known as the D drive etc. right up to the Z drive.

FLEXIBILITY

Unlike any other market system available at the time of print,  the  NEWLINE
system allows both cheque and bill replacement. This means that  the  system
must be managed unlike inflexible systems that do  not  allow  sophisticated
financial transactions. The system will not however, allow a  balance  until
all replaced cheques or bills have been properly cancelled  and  are  marked
as  such  in   the   audit   files.   See   CHEQUE   RECONCILLIATION   (List
Outstanding/Cancel/Duplicate Cheques) in Section 2 and LIST CANCEL  INVOICES
in Section 2.
