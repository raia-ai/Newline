BVD Test Details and Display Boards
The latest version of Salering will now display the BVD test details on the 7 x 30 Data Display Boards.
There are 3 different status descriptions. These are

No BVD Test which means that we do not have test result back from AIM in the system.

BVD Tested which means that we have a reply back from AIM re BVD and this is a code 2.

Contact DVO which means that something has come back positive and this is a code 1,3 or 4. We
should not get any of these really as these animals should not be sold but you never know.

The display board will just show one set of BVD details as there is not enough space to show the BVD
status against each animal. Therefore if all animals in a lot come back with a code 2 then we display
BVD Tested. If as per the screen example below we get an animal in a lot that is not tested we will
display ‘No BVD Test’ for this lot.




Examples of the display board with the different status information.
