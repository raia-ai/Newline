INTRO:

The ICBF have released a web service which is available to NAS users to show the status of cattle. The purpose of this facility is to give buyers extra information on the animals being sold in the mart and to assist in the purchasing of replacement bulls and heifers for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme. The ICBF will provide a Sale Day Catalogue.

BENEFITS:

Provides buyers in the sale ring more information about the quality of the cattle

HOW DOES IT WORK?

When the eartag is coming into the salering Newline queries the ICBF web service and displays the results on the TV screen in the ring.

The picture below shows example data which Newline gets back from the ICBF.

The TV display will show something along these lines at the bottom of the screen.

Not all animals will have stars or have stars high enough to show on the TV. Examples –

Only animals with 4 stars and over will be shown.

Animals must be:

Female or Pedigree Registered

Have a sire recorded

Lactation is 0

Beef evaluations will be shown if the animal is registered with an eligible breed as determined by the BDGP  Terms and conditions. Otherwise, dairy evaluations will be shown.

Herds must be in the BDGP scheme, or in Herdplus and have given the mart access to their data.

Data to be displayed:

Beef Pedigree Male - must be 4+ on Replacement or Terminal, within or across breed. Indexes and across breed stars shown for terminal and replacement

Beef Pedigree Female - must be 4+ on Replacement, within or across. Replacement Index, within and across breed stars shown

Beef Commercial Female - must be 4+ on Replacement. Replacement Index and across breed stars shown.

The entire board layout may look something like this.
