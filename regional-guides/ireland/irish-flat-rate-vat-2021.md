4th January 2021

Dear Newline Customer.

RE. Flat Rate VAT Rate Change January 1st, 2021

Newline wish you a happy and healthy 2021. We look forward to seeing you again when the pandemic is better under control. For now, we are only a phone call or facetime away and very happy to help.

We have been informed that the Farmer’s Flat-Rate VAT rate is changing from 1st January 2021. The details below are from the Revenue website.

https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-rates/search-vat-rates/current-vat-rates.aspx

Newline is able to amend the setting from 5.4% to 5.6% for you remotely. We interpret the change as a top up of an additional .2% from 5.4 to 5.6 and will show it as a separate record to the inclusive VAT on hammer price. BUT WILL NOT DO SO WITHOUT YOUR EXPRESS WRITTEN INSTRUCTION. Please confirm you wish Newline to make this change. Please note we are not onsite, and it is not possible for us to test the changes in all sales for you. It is your responsibility to run some test lots through the system in your sales and double check the seller’s payment statement printouts and buyers invoices are showing the new amended VAT rate correctly. Newline will not be held responsible for any errors and omissions excepted (E&OE). If you require assistance or guidance please contact Newline and we will be happy to help.

Yours sincerely.
