The focus when this screen loads is in the top left of the screen in the
Financial year box. You enter the financial year relating to the budget
figures you want to enter. E.G. Financial year 2006/2007 would be entered
as 2006.

You then have a number of different options on the screen for you to select
from. You can select whether you are entering a new set of figures or if
you are wanting to look at / amend figures already set up. You also have
the option along the top of the screen to select the district and the
channel relating to the set of figures you want to work with.

If you are entering a new set of figures then once you have selected the
district and channel if you enter the average value, commission rate and if
this is per head in the boxes alongside each of the different sections.
Once all of the required information has been entered here, you do not need
to fill in every box, you are then ready to progress to the next set of
boxes. Here you need to enter the tally for each section and once you enter
the required tally in the tally box the program will calculate the total
value and the commission from the details entered in the box to the left.
You need to enter the tally for each section for each of the different
periods. Once you have completed this click on the save button and the data
entered will be written away to the tables.

Once the information has been saved you can then select a different
district and then just amend the tally figures that need altering and then
save the information for this region.

If you want to clear the grid of information entered then click on the
clear button at the bottom of the screen. This will however clear both
grids of information.

You can view the information entered by clicking on the Look at / Amend
option at the top of the screen. This will re display the data already
entered for a district and channel and allow you to alter this information.
Once you have completed all the required alterations then click on save and
the new data will be saved to the tables in place of the original
information.

The look at / amend screen looks like this:
