Charges – Manifest Charges

Manifest Charges

Some charges will be specific to the manifest form \ entry form. A seller may send heifers separately from bulls for example and use two different truckers. They may wish to link the trucking charge to a specific manifest. If this is the case, ensure the Manifest number shows in the top left of the screen and click add charges button.

Double click the trucking charge from the list on the left hand side or type the charge number and press the enter key. Both methods do the same thing, just down to user preference.

Or

The manifest number is pre-entered against this charge.

This will reflect in the seller statement when you look to settle the cheque.
