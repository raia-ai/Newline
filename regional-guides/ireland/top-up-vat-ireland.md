Intro –

Farmers who are not VAT registered in Ireland are sometimes (varies from budget to budget and year to year) eligible to have a VAT refund on sales of livestock to compensate for VAT they pay on supplies.

5. Flat-rate farmers

5.1: A flat-rate farmer is a farmer who is not registered for VAT in respect of his/her farming activities. In order to compensate for VAT paid on supplies to him/her, such a farmer is entitled to a flat-rate addition (at present *.*%) to the prices at which his/her agricultural produce or agricultural services are supplied to VAT-registered persons including marts, agricultural co-operatives and meat factories. A flat-rate farmer is also entitled to reclaim VAT incurred in respect of the construction, extension, alteration or reconstruction of farm buildings, and land drainage, from the VAT Repayment (Unregistered) Section.

NAS settings –

The market staff must check that the customer VAT settings are correct. This is done in the customer account. A flat rate farmer should have a Y against their account. They are then eligible to get the top up refund on their seller cheque.

When viewing the list of sellers on a sale day and pressing enter to see all.

Note the VAT reg column. The majority of farmers in Ireland you would expect to see a Y in this column. They are the ones that will get a VAT refund. If you have a VAT number in there they are VAT registered and will not get a top up refund. If you have nothing in there they will not get a refund. It is up to the market user to ensure this is correct.

This is the sort of layout you would expect to see on the sellers cheque if they are a flat rate farmer. Note the top up VAT refund.
