Show Alley

What is Show Alley?

Show Alley is a service offered which involves weighing the cattle the day before the sale and uploading a catalogue online for buyers to view show alley cattle and value added information about them, to include: the sellers name; distance hauled to market; shrink % applied to the weight; feed; health details, providing the buyer with a very good picture of the quality of the livestock anticipated for sale.

VJV, Alberta – example:

All cattle sold in the VJV Canadian Gold Show List will be one owner, age and source Verified cattle. All cattle will be catalogued the day prior to the sale and made available for all Buyers, allowing each producer the ability to emphasizing their feed and health protocols.

Internet auction will give both buyers and sellers better marketing options, reduce Selling time and stress on all classes of cattle.

Show Alley Input

Within a sale menu select the input option.

Select Show Alley and click Continue.

Select the ring your scales are in and click Continue.

Select the section and click Continue.

Click Add Lot to add a new row to the grid.

Enter the presale pen the cattle are kept in before the sale. This enables interested buyers to locate and see them before the sale if they wish. Enter the number of head, capture the weight from the scales. Enter the sex, colour, seller and manifest details and click the save changes button.

Some marts with big pens keep more than one lot in a presort pen. They may sub divide these by putting BATCH or LOT, or something like that in the text of the presort pen.

Weight Input Filter

The Weight Input filter is basic information in the columns to quickly weigh and enter the cattle as they come to the scales, without adding all the value-added info at that point to not hold up the weighing process.

There are a selection of filters for different tasks in the Show Alley input process.

Xcira Export Filter

This filter is selected when the users are ready to upload catalogue \ lot information online.

Export lot to Xcira creates a CSV file in the required format for that online provider.

Upload lot to Xcira directly links via API to Xcira to upload the lots\ catalogue.

Full Show Alley Filter

The Full Show Alley mode provides additional columns for entering value added information. To add the same information to multiple columns the user clicks the enable multi-select tick box and drags the mouse and selection over the rows wanted. This selects all these rows as shown below.

Type the information and press the enter key.

Click yes to update all selected rows.

Shrink

Is the loss of fluid from the cells. Tissue shrinkage occurs after holding cattle off feed and water. It also occurs when cattle are subjected to stresses such as hauling. It becomes more important than excretory shrink the longer the shipping time. Since it is actual loss of tissue weight, it is harder to replace.

The further the animals are hauled the more shrink applied up to 3%. One estimate for shrink is 3 percent for the first 100 miles and 0.5 to 1.0 percent for each additional 100 miles.
