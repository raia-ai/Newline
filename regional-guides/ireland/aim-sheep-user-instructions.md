Get Business List / Going into the Sale

The first time the user goes into the sale on any given day  just  like  the
cattle sale does currently the system will talk  to  AIM  and  download  any
changes to customer status’ with AIM and save these details  in  an  offline
table within NAS. Customers who deal in both sheep and cattle  will  have  2
separate status’ stored against their account. A  cattle  status  and  sheep
status – which can be viewed in customer edit.

AIM Sheep User Operation

The inputting and sale of sheep will not be affected by using  NAS  to  send
sheep movement details to AIM. The inputting / pre-booking  or  full  lot  &
price input is unchanged. Newline have a service running in  the  background
(providing broadband is online) every minute or  so  that  checks  how  many
sheep lots have been booked in and sends them off to AIM  (this  happens  in
the background without user intervention.)   This  will  send  AIM  all  the
inwardard movement details.

Customer Edit Screen

The Add Ins menu has a check  herd\flockno  status  option.  AIM  have  told
Newline there are no plans to pre-clear sellers and that all  flock  status’
will be marked as ok to sell.

There are more options in the flock number frame, showing the sheep  selling
or buying status of a customer.  This  can  be  different  to  their  cattle
status.

Invoicing

Users must enter a destination flock number when producing a sheep invoice.
[pic]

If AIM do not have a record of the flock number  for  sheep  purchasing  the
user will see.

[pic]

If AIM do have a record but it is marked as  they  cannot  buy  the  message
will show

[pic]

If it is all ok the invoice will just come out as normal.

Sale Reports

Once all movements have been finalized and all invoices  produced  the  user
will need to send all movement records to AIM  before  they  can  close  the
sale.

The user can send all lots to AIM  in  one  go,  or  select  individual,  or
groups of lots to send. The select tick box needs to be ticked and the  Send
to AIM button clicked. If the inward / on to market movements have not  been
recorded because broadband was down, or the real-time service  of  Newline’s
was turned off these movements can be recorded later. If invoices  have  not
been produced this will only do inward movements, but if invoices have  been
produced it will also do  the  onward  /  off  market  movement.  When  both
movements are done nothing else should be altered for the lot.

When both are done the row will be highlighted in green.

If the seller herdno was not entered during lot input, it can be entered  in
this screen and the enter key pressed to save the from flock record.

[pic]

Then you can send the inward movement record. It cannot be sent without  the
from flock begin input.

[pic]

This report is for cattle or sheep to show which mart customers are on  stop
by AIM and what date they were put on stop.

[pic]

Tick the Cattle or Sheep options.

[pic]

Close Sale

The user cannot close the sale until all sheep movement recorded with AIM.
