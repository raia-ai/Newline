System Charges

There can be as many system charges as you require. These are charge name descriptions, defaults for which side they apply to: Seller; Buyer; Both. The default way in which they are charged: By Head; Percentage; Flat rate; etc. Our system is formula based which means there is a lot of flexibility to set up to work with many different charge requirements.

There is a wizard to setup new charge descriptions.

The system shows the admin user a wizard to setup a new charge. Work through the wizard choices.

Item Type charge

Will this charge be applied automatically to a specific item type? E.g. you charge $20 per head for all feeder cattle. The answer to this question should be Yes and then click next.

If however, the charge is to be manually added to a seller statement or buyer invoice the answer should be no and then click next.

Charge Name

Enter the charge name and click next.

Tax

Is this charge taxable? Click yes if it is and no if it is not.

Charge By

How are you calculating this charge? Select the default charge by from the combo choices.

Rate

Enter a rate if there is one.

Charge Group

Pay out to

You may wish to always pay a particular charge to another party. If you want to do this enter the customer account of the other party.

Nominal Codes

This screen enables a cross reference between the charge descriptions in NAS and the nominal or account codes used in your accountancy software. This allows an export csv file from the sale closing process to import into Sage accountancy packages.

To add a new nominal code click the Add New Nominal button. Select the charge from the combo in the bottom charge of the list. Add the charge and nominal code and click save nominals.

Print Order

If you want certain charges to be in order on your seller statement or buyer invoice paperwork you can set the print order. The charges at the top of the list will print first.

To move a charge up or down select the charge row and use the Move Up or Move Down button that become active. Click Save print order when you are finished.
