Charges – Charge By

Charge By

The system is preconfigured with 10 different charge by solutions. These can be added to by Newline if required.

By CWT

By CWT (By 100 Weight) allows the user to enter a $ rate and the system will provide the total weight.

In this example the total weight is 5555lbs so the maths is. (5555 / 100) x rate $5 = $277.75

If by CWT is selected as a charge by before lots have been pre-entered, i.e. at manifest entry stage the total weight is not known and this will be worked out later in the seller cheques program once the lots have been offered for sale. Therefore it is possible to add a CWT charge before the sale.

By CWT Day

A variation on by CWT has an addition multiplier of days.

By Head

The head figure is pre-populated by the number of head on actual lots in the sale for this seller. This can be added before the lots are entered and will calculate in the seller cheques once the lots have been offered for sale.

By Head 2nd Type

By Head Days

This option is user driven. The user enters the variables for days and head. It does not use lots to calculate the head as you may have 10 head in the lot but only wish to make a charge on 4 of them for instance.

By Head Multiplier

This option lets the user enter the number of head. It does not use the number of head in the lots. It is user driven.
