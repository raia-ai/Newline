Manifest Entry

Select the Manifest Entry option from the sale day menu.

Note many words may be specific to States, Provinces, Countries. NAS has the facility to customise menu descriptions and key words. In Alberta Canada Manifest describes the paperwork that arrives in the mart with the seller’s livestock. In Oklahoma USA a drive-in accompanies the livestock to market. The wording can be largely tailored to suite your requirements.

Select the section you wish to enter a manifest in and click the continue button.

Enter the manifest number and search for the seller name. Enter the number of heads and select the kind and color from the drop-down combo controls.

Note these controls show options from the kind and color tables and can be tailored to the customer requirements.

Enter the brand or select NVD if there is No Visible Brand. For States and Provinces that do not brand livestock this field does not need to be seen.

Enter some remarks to help ID the livestock and an unloaded time as this may be very useful if trying to resolve any issues and you wish to look back at the yard videos.

Click the save button or press the F5 function key on your keyboard.

Seller

The best way of searching for a seller name is to enter 3 letters from their surname, # symbol and 3 letters from their first name and press the enter key.

If only one match is found that customers name and address will be populated on the form. If more than one is found a list of choices will be displayed and the user may choose the correct one.

Kind

The user may type a number or the letter to auto populate the kind they require. The system can be configured to show a show description of the kind or a longer description. Our example below is a short description.

Color

The user may type a number to the left of the description or a letter from the color they require to auto populate the combo. Clicking on the combo or selecting by keyboard and pressing the enter key or tab key will select your choice.

Brand

LIS (Livestock Information Service) in Alberta provided a database feed for 20,000+ brands and this is used in NAS for selecting the brand information. As pictures were also provided in this feed NAS is able to show picture of the brand as well as word descriptions.

Charges

Charges can be added and linked to a specific manifest during the manifest entry process. See the charges tutorial for more information on adding charges.

Manifest Report

There is a manifest report which lists all the manifest that have been entered into the sale thus far.

Discrepancies Report

The discrepancies report is used to double check that all manifests entered have corresponding transactions\ lots sold or unsold by the end of the sale. It checks the seller selected in manifest entry agrees with the seller the ring clerk entered whilst selling the animals.

Charges Report

The charges report may be viewed as seller charges or buyer charges. All the charges added in the sale are shown in this report.

Configuration

In the cogs symbol, top right of the form you can find the configuration for adding kinds, colors and so on to the system.
