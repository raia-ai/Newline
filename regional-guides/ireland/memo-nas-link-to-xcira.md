NAS link to Xcira

Setup a sale \ event on Xcira from NAS

Inside the NAS sale select the input option.

Tech - Note if you set up the event \ sale using Ring Manager NAS will not be aware of the sale and will not be able to upload lots to it. Setting up the event in NAS lets Xcira pass a unique sale id to NAS and enables the link between the 2 systems.

Click the cogs in the top right of the screen.

Select setup Xcira sales from the drop down menu.

Select the section and itemtypes you want to send to Xcira On The Fly (OTF). This drives the focus in the selling screen to go to the Send to Xcira button when selling. Unticking Show Alley means the flow of selling skips the Send to Xcira button as the data is uploaded before the sale starts for Show Alley animals.

Click Setup sale.

If a sale is already setup you will see a red button delete sale from Xcira. This does what it says and deletes the sale \ event from online.

Show Alley – Upload to Xcira

Catalogue upload

Continue to upload the data to the vjvauction website in the same way. In the Show Alley entry screen in the Xcira Export view \ filter, renumber and sequence the lots. This part has changed as the sequence number for the Xcira clerk and OTF selling has to gaps between it now to allow for sub lots to be created in Weigh Off (WO) scenarios. The system automatically handles the sequence number for the upload to Xcria online clerk but does not for the upload of csv the website. Therefore the sequence number may show 0 in Xcira Export view, if it does renumber and re sequence and then export lots to Xcira

Use Ring Manager to import the csv file and update the website catalogue.

Upload Lots to Xcira Online Clerk

When you want to upload the lots to the Xcira online clerk and live event so viewers can see the lots listed, click upload lots to Xcira. This will automatically create a sequence id with a gap in it for sub lot creation.

Check the lots have been uploaded successfully by clicking on View Only on the VJV website.

Enter the auction

Check the lots. Ensure they are ordered 1 to whatever and not missing any lots. Scroll down the list.

The sequence number is a variable setting, at present set to 5 so each lot increments the sequence id by 5. This gives 5 sub lots per lot. It can be amended if necessary by Newline.

Selling

Sell as normal using enter button to move down the screen. The focus will come to the send to Xcira button. Press enter or click it to send the lot to the Xcira clerk. Viewers will see it in the list of lots at the bottom and the Xcira clerk will see a flashing red notification, New Inventory. They just click the arrow right button to call this lot on the block so it appears online and on the TVs.

OTF lot modifications

Sub lots or changes to lots the NAS clerk is dealing with can be sent to Xcira by clicking the send to Xcira button. If the Xcira clerk does not have that lot on the block they will accept the change and be able to show it. If the Xcira clerk is on the block they will reject the change. The Xcira clerk will have to manually edit the lot details as they do presently in that case.
