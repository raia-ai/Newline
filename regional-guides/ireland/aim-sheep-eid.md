AIM Sheep EID

Introduction

Summer 2019 and marts in Ireland have the option to become CPRs (Central Points of Recording). This document explains how NAS facilitates the AIM CPR requirements.

EID System Menu

Within the sale day menu the user will find the EID system menu.

Read EID Tags In Pens

Most marts in Ireland will read sheep EID tags in pens before the sheep are sold. It largely depends on the layout and procedures the mart operates whether this is the best solution for you. Please discuss with Newline.

The PENS in GREEN indicate the same number of TAGS read compared to the number of sheep pre-entered in that PEN in the market system.

The PENS in BLUE indicate TAGS read in the EID system, the total number does not tally with the market system (or stock has not been booked into the market system at this time). If stock is to be entered into the market system after the sheep TAGS have been read the PENS should go green when the tags read and tags pre-entered for a given pen agree. Any PENS still blue indicate a discrepancy between what has been read in the yard and what has been entered into the market system.

Scan \ read tags in a pen

If you have a pen tag attached to your pens scan it to select the pen you are about to scan into. If you do not have pen tags click the reader button. This button is linked to a specific stick. Stick 1 will relate to reader 1. Stick 2 to reader 2 and so on and type the pen number you are at.

Then scan the tags in that pen.

History

EID Hardware

Shearwell EID Stick Readers

New sticks in 2019 come installed with V1.55 firmware on them.

The blue light indicates an successful Bluetooth link to a tablet or PC.

NAS has 2 way communication with Shearwell sticks. This is beneficial in pen reading scenarios.

The picture shows the stick knows the user is reading in pen 1 and that there are 4 pre-entered heads in this lot. So far there have been 0 EID reads against the 4 head pre-entered in the lot in NAS.

In the example below the user is working in pen 2 and there should be 5 heads in the lot. 1 of 5 EID tags have been read.

When a tag is successfully read the light on the end goes green.

If the tag has been read before the end goes red.

Duplicate Tag

If a tag is read in two different pens the system warns the user. This can happen if a sheep jumps out of their pen, they are moved in error or they stick their head through the next pen when the yard staff is reading them.

The user has a choice to delete a tag from the wrong pen.

Batteries

VERY IMPORTANT – USE GOOD QUALITY RECHARGABLE BATTERIES

Battery recommendation for Shearwell EID stick readers.

The most frequent support call for EID issues is related to Bluetooth connectivity to sticks. 99.9% of the time the issue is resolved by putting in new fully charged batteries. Rechargeable batteries only have a certain number of charges in them before they being to fail. Not all batteries are the same quality. Look for batteries with a high Mah.

The battery requirement for the Stick readers are 4 x AA Batteries.

Not all AA type batteries are the same however so particular attention needs to be applied to the mAH (milli -Amp Hours) rating which is usually printed on the battery or packaging.

We advise a rating of 2400 - 3500 mAH rechargeable AA and a battery charger capable of recharge between 90 mins to 8 hours.

Invest in higher quality rechargeable batteries

The higher the mAH rating the longer the battery will last.

Most battery manufacturers have the high output 2400-2700mah in their range.

Higher Power from Powerex below.

Replace old rechargeable batteries every year.

Tablets

NAS Tech Configuration

USINGEIDSYSTEM = Y

CPRC_MART = Y

ONSCREENKEYPAD – Give tablet users bespoke NAS keypad for easier data entry.

CPRC_MART_LIVE set to Y if we are doing the movement reporting to AIM for the sheep with the EID tags. Currently with just the one key we had turned on the CPRC operation but then the movement reporting was only going to send to AIM the lots with EID tags read so this new key controls if we need to send these.
