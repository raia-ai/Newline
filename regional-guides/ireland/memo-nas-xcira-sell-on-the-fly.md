NAS & Xcira Sell on the Fly UAT

UAT system set up on 2nd instance of NAS as Ponoka

Setup an Xcira online sale

Go into input and click the cogs. Click Setup Xcira Sales.

Select the Xcira Lane from the Xcira configuration drop down combo. Select the Newline sale from the Newline sale drop down combo. Enter a sale description and a browser window title.

Tick the itemtypes that will be sent to Xcira on the fly. Note show alley sent earlier so does not need to be ticked.

Set up the start and end date. Click the Setup Sale button. This will setup the sale online with Xcira.

Tech:

The configure button is for Xcira tech support. They setup lane details and map the NAS fields that they want to display online with the Xcira online database.

Show Alley Upload

In Xcira Export mode there is a new button option, upload lots to Xcira. This is used to upload the Show Alley lots from NAS on the live online sale ready for bidding. To populate the online web catalogue the VJV user will still need to export lots to Xcira via csv.

The sequence number system has changed to facilitate any cutbacks in the Show Alley sale. There is now an auto gap entered in the sequencing to enable cutbacks to be sold on the fly in Xcira.

Selling

There is a send to Xcira button for selling on the fly cattle on Xcira.

The clerk will type the lot info as normal as they see it enter the ring and the focus will drop from colour to the Send to Xcira button. When the user presses the enter key the lot is sent to Xcira. Alternatively, the user can click the send to Xcira button. For Show Alley lots that have already been uploaded if you set the sale up and did not tick show alley to auto focus the focus moves from colour to price and jumps the button as the lot data already online. The user can edit data and click the Send to Xcira if they have made an error before they have sold the lot.

The Send To Xcira button goes green when the lot has been sent.

Note – only ring 1 setup for UAT with on the fly. Once tested and debugged we will set up ring 2 mode to UAT.
