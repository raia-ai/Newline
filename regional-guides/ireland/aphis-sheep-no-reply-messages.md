Aphis Timeout Issues

Our app waits for 15 minutes to see if we receive a reply from Aphis. If we do not this error message is shown.

There will be a further prompt now to allow users to flag the GDoc transactions as sent successfully to Aphis. See message box below.

It defaults to No so they have to read it and click yes only if they have double checked the status with Aphis staff.

There is also a utility menu which only shows under the Newline user access level. We can use this to flag GDoc movement flags if Aphis have confirmed they have received them.

Our normal util password

Enter the GDoc number and click ok. This will flag the movement flag as 3 (i.e. Aphis have in and out movements). Only do this if Aphis have confirmed they have the movements.
