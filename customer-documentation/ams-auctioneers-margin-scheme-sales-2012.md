Margin Scheme Sales
Lot Labels:

m = Margin Scheme Lot
v = Vat Lot
e = Export Lot
z = Zero Rated Lot

Margin Scheme Sales:

If a seller is not vat  registered  he  is  by  default  selling  under  the
auctioneer margin scheme. Any lots against  this  type  of  customer  should
have an m against them.

If a seller is vat registered he is NOT selling under the auctioneer  margin
scheme. Any lots against this type of  customer  should  have  a  v  against
them.

If a purchaser is in the EU and is vat registered they do  not  pay  VAT  on
goods and the lot’s should be marked with an e for  the  purchaser  and  the
seller. For any purchaser outside of GB the lot label should be e.

If a lot is booked in and the item type has N for No Vat the  status  should
be z for zero rated.

Commissions and VAT:

For lots that are sold with Vat, the vat should  show  separately  from  the
goods. The vat on commission should be included in  the  commission  figure.
If the purchaser is vat reg’d the printout message should state  the  amount
of VAT that is reclaimable including the VAT element of the commission.

For lots sold on  the  margin  scheme.  The  vat  on  commission  should  be
included in the commission figure. No matter what the purchaser  Vat  status
they are not by law allowed to reclaim the Vat.

There is some debate between auctioneers how the vat  on  commission  should
show for vatable lots, by default I think we should do the  above,  as  long
as we have quick and easy way to change it if required.
