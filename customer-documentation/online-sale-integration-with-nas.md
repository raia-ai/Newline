Online Sale Integration in NAS

NAS users may wish to conduct online sales. NAS integrates with several online sale providers like Xcira, iBidder, saleroom.com, etc. NAS users may wish to prebook lots into NAS and export a file to send to one of these online providers or may wish to book directly online. During and after the online sale users may download registered buyer details, lot details and sale price details and import the data straight into NAS to enable the production of sellers statements and buyers invoices.

Export Pre-Booked Data:

To export pre-booked lot details go into 21 sale totals, rick click the section you wish to export and click view all lots.  Then click the options menu and the export choice.

Tick the fields of data you intend to export and click the next button.

Save the file and note the file location so you may browse to the file and email it from your email.

Import:

Import Lots:

NAS has the ability to download lots from online sales. Click import lot details and select the itemtype you wish to give the lots.

Click the contine button.

Browse to the lot data file that you have saved from your online sale provider (Xcira, etc).

Enter the NAS customer account number and click the ok button.

This example shows 25 lots will be downloaded from the online sale and imported into NAS. The NAS sale in the example already has one lot loaded in it.

You can view the downloaded lots in the sale totals. Note number entered 26 as NAS already had a lot booked into it before downloading 25 from the Internet.

Import Registered Buyers:

Buyers that register online may be downloaded into NAS. Select Import Buyer Name and Address Details. New buyers not loaded onto NAS already show in white and say NEW against them under the Acc No column. You may pick a group to record them against. Many NAS users choose to record these buyers against an Internet Bidder group. This provides a mailshot group for you at a later date.

These new customers are loaded onto NAS automatically from the download. Existing customers are shown in blue.

Import Lots / Prices:

When downloading the price and buyer the buyer number (paddle no) must already have been downloaded into NAS. If it is the status shows as register buyer. If not it shows as unable to update. You will either need to download all buyers as per step 2 or add a buyer number to the appropraite account and try again.
