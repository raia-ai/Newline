There is a facility in NAS called “Enter Buyer Cheque Details” to reconcile the cheques paid by buyers on the sale day to pay off the buyers invoices agree with the physical cheques held by the auction staff at the end of the day. This process is a double check to ensure:

Cheque(s) has not been misplaced or lost

the invoice has been marked as paid incorrectly

the invoice has been marked as unpaid incorrectly

the wrong payment type has been chosen in error (e.g. cash instead of cheque)

third party cheques are allocated and recorded correctly

Example 1 : An Old Debt is paid off via the invoice program.

The buyer comes in for his invoice and decides to pay off last weeks debt.

The invoice above shows the buyer has paid off an old debt of 2667.00

This figure is then available in the enter buyer cheque details menu. See below:

It shows the paid amount from the invoice screen and the chq amt from the reconciliation screen. The 2 figures should agree and the user should have a physical cheque for this amount. It is a good idea to note the buyers account number on the back of the cheque when the user takes it. This helps during this reconciliation process, especially if third party cheques are involved.

The reconciliation program shows the list of cheques received.

The user may decide to record the chq no, sort code, acc no, last payee and drawer (these details are particularly important if cheques do not clear the bank later and they). It can be especially tricky to find details about third party cheques if you do not record them here! As these details are entered the system shows a balance at the bottom left of the screen.

Example 2: Today’s invoice is paid in full

Note the white background on the row with K304 in the list of invoices paid shows that the paid amt and chq amt do not agree. In this example there is a difference of the discount figure. The user can over type the value in the list of cheques received cell to correct this.

Example 3: Today’s invoice is over paid by third party cheques

Note: Buyers Payments put into the ledger program or old debts paid off in the sale (but not in the invoice program) are not recorded in the list of invoices paid by cheque column. Therefore if you manually add these cheques into the list of cheques received you may find the invoice cheque total and total cheques received total vary by the total of other old debts paid in the ledger.

Sale Control Report

This report has a very useful feature to additionally help balance the buyers payments made during the sale day, including ledger payments made on the day.

Double click the paid by cheque row.

This report shows the invoices paid by cheque but also shows old debts paid off in the ledger during the sale day.
