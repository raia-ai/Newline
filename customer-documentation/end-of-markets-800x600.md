END OF MARKETS

The End of Markets are now designed to print to file  rather  than  printer.
This means there is no longer any need to print any or all  of  the  reports
if you do not want to. At the end of the run the following screen appears.

The  year  and  the  market  you  have  just   closed   will   be   selected
automatically. If you do not want to print them click the F8 Cancel  button.
If you do want to print them tick the ones  you  want  and  click  the  Next
button. After selection the report is  displayed  on  screen  with  a  print
option. Reports can be viewed on the screen.
