                                   New Sold Subject Option

There is a new feature in the Salering program that will allow the operator to set a lot as being sold
subject to the seller agreeing the price. This is used when the seller is not at the sale and will stop
the buyer from being able to have a list, passout or invoice.

Salering Screen.




If the user ticks this box when selling the transaction(s) will be updated with a Y in the SoldSubject
field. This tick box will stay ticked for all lots for that seller so once ticked they user does not have to
remember to tick it for the rest of that sellers lots.

Invoice Screen.
You will see on the above screen that the last 4 lots on this invoice have been sold ‘Subject to
Vendors Approval’ which is why they have the SS in the SS column. If you then try and print a List,
Passout or Invoice for this customer you will get the following screen.




You can still select the lots without the SS and produce the required paperwork for these but you
will not be able to select the lots with SS against them.

Cheque Option.
Again on the cheque screen you can see the lots flagged as having been sold ‘Subject to Vendors
Approval’. If you try to print a cheque or list for this account you will get the following message
appear.




If you say Yes they are OK to be sold the system will remove the Y from the field and allow you to
print out the sellers cheque or list. The screen will then look like this.
Once this has been cleared the purchaser side of the operation is ok to proceed and it will be
possible to print a List, Passout or Invoice for the purchaser.
