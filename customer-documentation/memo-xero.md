Xero

Files produced from Newline for import into Xero. The Xero accounts are cross referenced in NAS in a front-end UI and when sales are closed files as shown below are produced and may be imported into Xero.

Sales Ledger BACs

Sale details

If you pay the sellers by BACS this figure is shown in the file. I think we can show grouped or separate depending on how your bank statements are shown for reconciliation purposes.

If you pay some sellers by cheque then each cheque record is shown in the file to allow you to do bank reconciliation in XERO.

This keeps the sale ledger control account in Xero balanced to the sales ledger in NAS. On non-sale days when payments are made by buyers a file is produced when the daybook is printed. Keeping NAS and Xero in step.

Use Move Money feature in Xero to from clearing accounts to bank accounts. The clearing accounts come back to zero to know you have moved money correctly.

VAT on goods for VATABLE sales is WIP. Currently a manual posting is done for this by the Xero user.
