Printing Lot Labels.

Via

When first running the label option if the Market No. of the sale selected has not been configured when attempting to print labels you are given a warning message.

Selecting “A4 Avery Labels” will bring up the following screen.

There are 3 label formats curently configured with their relevant industry standard Avery codes. The number after the “ x “ relates to the number of labels per page.

The “Avery L7651 x 65” is a really small label and you are limited to what will print.

The information that prints on the label is in a fixed position (eg irrespective of how the label is configured the Lot No. will always print out in the same postion on the label). There is currently no option to change font size or font.
