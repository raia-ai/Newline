Searching for records in Bank Reconciliation




A number of new fields have been added to the search function to help users find values, ranges of
values and different types of transaction.

The from val and to val allows a user to enter a value range for instance from .01 to .99 or 345.55 to
350.00. This may be useful trying to identify anomalies when trying to balance control account periods.




Note search by all option selected.

Cancelling Cheques (and other transaction types):
If a bank control account period has been reconciled and you try to set the cancelled cheque date in
the past during a reconciled period you will not be able to do this. You can still cancel transactions but
the cancelled date must be in a current period and not a past reconciled one.
