 NEW RICS CREDIT / DEBIT REPORTS                                                                  2014

There are two new reports in the Simple List of Debtors Options in the Sales Ledger Menu. If you run
the Simple List of Debtors as normal you will see the normal grid with the list of outstanding debt
information. There is a new menu option at the top of the screen which will give you the following
options is selected.




If you click on the top option then the system will produce a list similar to the Simple List of Debtors
but just with customers that have a credit balance on any transactions. The option will total these
credit balances up and display them aged week by week with a total overall balance.

The second option will produce a similar report but just for customers with a debit transaction
balance.

Both of these reports will ignore the other type of transaction so customers might appear on both
lists of you own them money and they own you money.

Their overall balance will be shown on the normal Simple List of Debtors screen.
