IMPORTANT

MAJOR INSTALLATION MENU IMPROVEMENTS – ACTION MUST BE TAKEN BY YOU!!

During the pre-book; entering lots during the sale and sell pre-booked  lots
options you are asked a number of questions about fat or store; terminal  in
sale ring; sell multiple lots and so on each time you enter  these  options.
The new changes get  rid  of  all  these  questions,  but  it  is  EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT to set these options up in the installation menu.

In the Installation Menu, Market Details option you will see a  new  windows
style menu. Changes will need to be made in each SALE FOLDER you run.

MAKE BREED GROUPS OR ITEM GROUPS

Under the Company Settings menu (top left of page)  select  the  Group  Type
(Breed) Codes option.

[pic]

This will allow you to setup Groups/Breeds for Cattle, Sheep, Pigs,  Horses,
Groups for Furniture, Carpets, Paintings, etc. What this then means is  that
you can specify which breeds or items belong to which groups, and  therefore
when you are booking in sheep you will only see sheep  breeds,  if  you  are
booking in carpets, you will only see types of  carpets,  or  paintings  you
will see types of painting. E.g. Oil, Water, etc.

NB. For Livestock Firms Cattle must be set up as =  to  B  for  beef.  Sheep
must be set up as L for lamb. These correspond to the animal  type  settings
in Option 5 of the installation menu, where  certain  stock  are  set  as  B
types for beef and others set as L types for lamb.

Arrow up and down the list and click enter to add a Breed  Type,  or  Double
Click the Row you want. Type in the breed/group description  and  click  Ok.
Make sure you click the Save & Exit button.

Setting the Booking in Questions

Fatstock
Back on the  Section  Settings  Menu  select  the  section  for  Fat  Cattle
edit/change the options you require. Tick the Prime Stock tick box.  If  you
sell in the sale ring with a PC or laptop tick this  option.  IMPORTANT  You
must click the Save button to save the changes you make.

If you do not save the changes you are reminded.  Select  Yes  to  save  the
changes and No to not save them.

Storestock
These options are important for store cattle also as you may  want  to  sell
multiple lots. For instance if you sell lot 4/5 together you  will  have  to
have ticked the  sell  multiple  lots  options.  (This  does  not  apply  to
salering software users).

Auto Sell Same Lot Number-
It is disabled if section set as Lot Checking On. If you  sell  a  bunch  of
store cattle with the same lot number then this needs to be ticked.

Sheep
Auto Create sub lots is relevant to sheep sales, and allows  lot  1  with  5
heads to be split and have a lot 1A if the lot is split. It is  disabled  if
the item types in the section are set as single heads in lots.  i.e.  number
of heads question set as N.

Enter Sale Ring Number-
This option is only relevant  to  companies  that  use  the  system  to  run
display boards in canteens or concourses that show what is happening in  any
given ring during the sale.

VB Prebook / Input
This option is for fineart sales and provides the user with a windows  style
lot entry system with enhanced features such as additional description.

button.

and drop it into the right hand box, or click the > button to move it over.

If it is already in a section it will warn you  and  ask  you  what  to  do.
Again ensure you click the save button to keep any changes you make, or  the
cancel button to display the tick box settings again.

 It is very important that you test the booking in and selling options  once
you have made these changes, at least the day before any sale. If  you  have
any queries ring Newline.




You will also need to cross reference each breed with  the  breed  type.  In
the Installation menu select option 11 – Breed File. This will  need  to  be
done in each market you run which you enter breeds or groups into.

PUPPY – Program Update Packages For You.

To avoid having the logistical problem of burning and sending  out  sporadic
CDs Newline have developed a piece of software designed to keep  you  up-to-
date with software developments and bug fixes. It is called  PUPPY  and  has
an icon of a PUPPY that sits on the desktop.

For those of you that  do  not  currently  have  this  installed  the  setup
program is contained on the CD you have been sent please call Toby  to  help
set this up.

There must be a live Internet connection for this program  to  work,  as  it
dials a server at Newline to get the latest programs. Once you  are  certain
you have an Internet connection click the Connect button. The label  in  the
bottom left of the screen tells you what it is trying to do. You should  see
it say connecting, and then connected. If there are  updates  to  install  a
list will appear. Double click the update and click the Install Next  Update
button.

[pic]

The program asks…

[pic]

Click the yes button. You are then given an  estimated  time  and  when  you
click Yes the progress bar will start to move.

When Newline post updates you will receive an  email  alerting  you  to  the
need to pick them up. Please make sure we have the right email  address  for
you so you get these emails.

Bug Fix

There was a duplicate lot bug, when  a  new  item  type  was  added  in  the
installation and the price option set to N, rather than P or K.  This  would
book a lot through and show no buyer but would write it away to A1. This  is
now fixed.

Close Accounts

Set the Account Status to C  in  the  customer  edit  form  and  remake  the
customer index and that customer will no long appear in the search lists.
