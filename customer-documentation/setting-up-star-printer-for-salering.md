                    Setting up Star Printer for Salering:

    • Install generic text only driver

    • Change port to relevant USB port

    • Set printer as default

    • Copy PRNTDIR.EXE & PRNTDIR.HLP from:
      \\ftpserver\ftpnewline\SR2000 Setup 1\Support
      and copy them into c:\windows\system32

    • Double click on prntdir.exe to run it.

    • In salering click on printing button with green tick, say no to test
      page.

    • Select character 20. If you select character 80 it will print but it
      will not put on the sale name, lot header info and it will not tear
      off.

    • When the first lot is brought into salering the name of the sale will
      be printed. As each lot is sold it will print them and when the vendor
      changes or the sale is ended it will tear off that printout.
