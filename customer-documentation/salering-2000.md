                               VERY IMPORTANT

    The WB button is an on/off switch for writing sales back to the main
  system. If the switch is set to no write back the system will not sell to
                              the main system!!

  Choosing a lot couldn’t be easier – just enter the lot number and, if you
                             want, a weight too!
      If the beast has an electronic eartag the lot number will appear
                               automatically.

   Plus now there’s no need for a lot number, simply click the Next Batch
                                   button.

              So you’ve chosen a lot & you’re ready to sell it…

    Track down a customer in a flash by entering his unique number or by
    entering his surname and, if you prefer any part of his first line of
 address/initials. Please note the use of the # as above. New Customers can
   also be added if they are not found in the database.  FABBL vendors are
   shown with a simple * next to the lots on the display board, and a blue
                  Customer Info box on the computer screen.
                                    [pic]
  Instantly displays the Customer, if it’s wrong go back and choose another
                        or press F1 to add a new one…

  Sometimes the display board is out of view of the auctioneer so SaleRing
    2000 provides a useful alternative…The Display Mirror. Choose this by
  clicking anywhere on the small display. Turn off again by clicking on the
                                 large one.

                                    [pic]

    Plus the large mirror can be easily moved around the screen to suit…

   Please note that the Clear button clears the display screen completely.
