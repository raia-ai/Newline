SETTING UP SALES IN SHETLAND.

The Newline system  has  an  option  called  Create  markets  for  transfer.
Essentially this sets up all new customers, new debts etc., and  puts  these
in a Sale ready to be used. At the end of a sale the End Of market  routines
updates the main MARKET directory (folder) with  new  customers  and  debts.
Until this is done the user may be confused  to  find  a  new  name  on  the
current market but not on the main market. The Sales ledger  is  looking  at
the main MARKET not the current market and  the  new  customer  hasn’t  been
updated to MARKET at this point.

Although  this  may  appear  at  first  to  be  convoluted  it  allows   the
flexibility to run  remote  markets,  cancel  invoices  etc.  and  generally
improves the system.

In order to set up any market ready for  use  the  system  administrator  at
Shetland chooses the market he wishes to transfer (e.g. Sale2, Sale5  etc.),
and making sure  it  has  already  been  properly  shut  down,  updated  and
archived, he sets up a new market at option 6 of the Main  Menu.  Once  this
has been done he comes out to the Windows desktop. The system  administrator
then clicks the Newline market icon again and  chooses  Create  markets  for
transfer in the opening Newline menu. There should only be  one  PC  set  up
with this option. The system will prompt,  “Choose  market  name  ready  for
transfer”. This is similar to the run a market  prompt.  Just  type  in  the
market concerned such as Sale2 or Sale5.   The  system  then  prompts  C  to
continue or  E  to  escape.  Make  sure  you  are  in  capitals  and  answer
appropriately. The system then warns you that there must be no  one  working
in this particular market at the time and asks you to  type  the  word  “GO”
and press enter when you are ready to proceed. At this  stage  the  computer
will address the  appropriate  data  and  compress  it.  The  computer  then
prompts:

 Back to menu          [B]        Create transfer disk [D]
Create modem file   [M]                  Create ISDN file      [I]

In the case of a normal Shetland sale choose [B] and press  enter.  You  are
then ready to run the sale as normal.

If a real remote sale  is  required  refer  to  the  Overview  document  and
contact a Newline member of staff.
