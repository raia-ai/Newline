From the Sale Menu Select

[pic]

I’ve amend NASBEND version 3.0.103 to have a new option 9 in this menu.

There is an inputbox which appears (blank) for a password to be entered.

The password is UTILITY. The idea is to prevent user from using this in
curiosity.

This loads an app called vbutility.exe

Read the onscreen tips. Make a safe copy of the transactions before running
this utility.

Be aware: It does not differential between cattle and sheep item types at
present. So if you wanted to change all blank movement flags to M it would
do this across all transactions currently.

When you’ve put in the 1 character or space for blank character in the from
and to text boxes click the Amend Now button.

F8 or Escape or the x will close the app.
