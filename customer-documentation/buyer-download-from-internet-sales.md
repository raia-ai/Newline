                        Buyer Download from Internet Sales.

When the buyers details are downloaded from the Internet sale the system will update the customer
details with an Internet Buyer mailing code. Then when the buyers from the next sale are downloaded
the system will search for the e-mail address of the buyer being downloaded and look to see if they
have an account on the system. If the program finds a match it will then check to see if this account
has an Internet Buyer mailing code and if it does then the program will use this account for that sale.
If there is an e-mail address match but the customer record in NAS does not have an Internet Buyer
mailing code then the program will create a new account for this buyer.

This will mean that if a customer comes to a sale and buys and also buyer at some sales via the
internet they will have two accounts on the system.

The reason for having two accounts is so that you can set up an Internet Buyer Charge and set this to
only charge buyers with an Internet Mailing code. So if a buyer buys from the internet you can enter
the price and buyer number as normal but because the account that the buyer number links to has
this mailing code the system will automatically charge the required Internet Buyer Fee.

The second account can also have a different buyer number than the normal account that the buyer
might use if they attend the sale in person. I would suggest perhaps starting the internet buyer
numbers from say 14000 so you can easily tell if the buyer is an internet buyer from their buyer
number. It does not matter what number range you use as long as it does not clash with the numbers
you give out at the sale.

This shows that this customer has an internet buyer number and is setup with an internet mail code
so they will get charged the Internet Buyer Charge if they buy in an internet sale.

This will also mean that for the operator entering the prices from the sales sheets can just enter the
price and buyer number for all of the lots as they do currently without having to worry about if the
buyer is an internet buyer or not.
