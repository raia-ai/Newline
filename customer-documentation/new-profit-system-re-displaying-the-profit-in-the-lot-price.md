New Profit System re displaying the profit in the lot price.

The new profit system does not add the profit amount on to the invoice as a
charge now it includes this in the price of the item and in the gross. You
enter the profit in the same was as before but remember the profit value
you are entering is the value per head. Therefore in cattle you enter the
price in the same way as before but with sheep the value of the profit
entered is the value per head. Therefore if you had 20 sheep and you wanted
to add £10 profit on you would enter a value of .50p and the system will
work out the total value. The invoice screen will then display the details
of the profit as follows.

You will see the actual profit entered against each transaction. It does
not show this on the invoice but adds the two figures together. The gross
on the screen is the actual gross including the profit.

The sellers are paid the profit in the same way as before. I have fixed the
cancelling of profit cheques so you can now go in to the profit cheque on
screen and enter A to cancel and it will then cancel the profit cheque and
allow the user to re print this.
