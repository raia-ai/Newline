Lot Store(s)

Lot store(s) enable users to set up a store or different stores to record items left on site by sellers, or noted in on an entry form for a future sale but not onsite yet. These items are not going to be immediately pre-booked into a specific sale. These items can at a later date by imported into sales.

Add Lot Store Names

From the main menu select option 8. Lot Store

Then select

If you get this message you are not set up to run a lot store please contact Newline.

If you are setup to use lotstores the user will see

Click the Add button to set up a new lot store. Set up as many types of store as you require and then click the save button.

The example shows a client with 3 lot stores. The lotstore font size has been increased to make it easier to view.

Manually Enter Lots into a Store

Select the store you wish to enter the lots into by ticking the select tixbox.

Click the continue button.

The system will load the pre-book lots screen. Enter the lots into the lot store using the same process you would to enter lots into a sale.

The system defaults the item as being onsite. See the tick box during item entry. If it is not onsite at that moment (the user only has a entry form but not the actual item yet) then untick onsite.

NAS may be used to print out seller labels (these may show the sellers name and address for contact reasons or lot / item descriptions which may be stuck on the lot for ID purposes). Some bigger items may require more than one label. When booking the item into the lot store the user can determine how many labels they require for any given item.

View Lots in Store

Select the store you wish to view and click continue. Or do not select any store and click continue to see all items in the store(s).

The lotstore opens and shows and will limit the number of columns to the most relevant for most users.

Menu Options provide the user a method to filter the lotstore

The filter may be set by seller, keyword search (i.e. item description), date entered, on site or off site, item no and so on. The user may also filter by how many times the item has been offered for sale already. This is a useful setting as it may be used to determine when to skip or return the item to the seller if it is just not selling.

Under the status column the user can skip items that will not sell and the seller does not want back, or they can mark the status as returned to vendor/seller. To view the history of skipped lots the user can tick the appropriate checkbox and click the apply button.

Edit Lot Store Items

Double click the item in the lotstore to view the edit option.

Amend the data you wish to amend and click the save button.

Customise columns in lot store

The user may select this from the options menu and determine what columns they wish to see.

Tick / untick as required. This may be useful if sending the seller as report of what lots they have in the lotstore or what lots you plan to return to them, skip, etc. By applying a seller filter the print seller menu becomes enabled which let the NAS user print a specific seller report.

Lot Store within Sales

Option 6. Within a sale menu is the lot store.

Users can move unsold lots from a sale back into a lot store so these can be processed into another sale later without having to re-type the lots.

Tick the lots you want to send to the store and click the update button.

Enter the new lot number you want the lot from the store to become in the sale you are moving it into. Click the selected tick box and click the file and update menu in the top left of the screen.

Each time an item is moved from the store to a sale, or from the sale back to a store the previous sales number is incremented.

This is useful as it lets you know how many times you have attempted to sell this lot. Is the reserve to high?

Other columns have been added to the lotstore in 2014. The Onsite column (explained earlier) and the Item No. Some items are given a unique item number that stays with them no matter how many sales they are entered into (if they do not sell) even though they may have different lot numbers in the different sales.
