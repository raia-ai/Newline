Bank Accounts Control

The purpose of this report is to balance the bank account and the bank statement balance against the cheques issued and lodgements made through the Newline system. It is also used to show the complete exposure the auction firm faces should all the cheques they have issued be cleared through the bank.

Each period there is an opening balance which is the balance carried forward / closing balance from the previous period. This figure – cheques issued (i.e. expenditure as the auciton is paying this out) + lodgements (income. Money paid in by the buyers) + or – debits and credits depending on what happened during that period will come to the balance to C/F figure. When the cheques that have not been cleared yet is added to this figure the result should be the bank statement figure.

Another way of putting this is the bank statement figure less the cheques that have not cleared yet equals the balance c/f (or the next periods opening balance).

It will show this information:

Note figures in picture made up and may not balance.

The sum is

Opening Balance

Less issued chqs

Plus payments \ lodgements into the bank

Less or Plus other debits \ credits

Equals balance carried forward

Plus issued chqs unmatched C/F

Less issued lodgements unmatched C/F

Equals actually bank statement on last date of control account period.
