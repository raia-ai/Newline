NEWLINE SOFTWARE UPDATE 2 & BUG FIXES – May 2003

To Install from the CD
Put the CD in the CDROM drive. It should auto run. Click the “Start Update”
button.
You should then see messages about files being copied and it will tell you that
it has completed and press any key to exit.

Musts
NB. There are a couple of things you must do for the update to work properly.
1) You need to go into the Installation Menu in each market folder you run,
and into the Amend Animal Type Settings, and pick any of the Animal Types
and just press the return key to move through the pages. Nothing will appear
to happen but it runs an important program that will ensure the market system
will run as it should.
2) Go into the Installation menu in the main MARKET folder. Pick option 10
End of Market Reports to Print. If you use Sage in conjunction with the market
make sure Report 19 has a Y next to it. If you do not use Sage this must be
set to N, otherwise you will experience problems in the end of market reports.
3) Run Program Update on all workstations
4) Check the printer settings on printers used to print the End of Market
Reports
5) Put through some dummy lots and print off a test bill and cheque before
running a live sale.

General Direction of Updates
Newline are constantly improving and developing new software. We are
writing new programs to increase the services that our package provides and
improving existing programs. One such improvement is the rewriting of
existing programs from the normal blue screen non mouse programs, to the
new windows like mouse enabled programs. All these new programs have a
new print method that allows the user to print to any printer. The new
programs are written in Visual Basic and as I say are much more windows
orientated, they provide benefits to our programmers who can do far more
with them and they are quicker to use in terms of setting things up at the user
end.

Specific Updates

OTMs
The price set for OTMs changes every month, but is always the same for that
month and clients have been asking us “why do they always have to enter the
same price in over and over again when booking OTMs through”. Well now
you don’t, because in the animal type settings in the installation menu you can
set a Set Price against the OTM animal type. This is the fourth page of the
animal type settings, with all the Yes and No answers. If you want to use a
Set Price select the line number to amend, and press enter until the cursor is
under the appropriate heading, then enter the price in pounds and pence and
press the enter key. The default setting is the price entered in the installation,
but it can be over written by entering a different price and pressing return at
the price prompt: - You will need to change it in the installation whenever the
OTM price changes but it will save you entering in the price over and over
again every time you book an OTM through.

Reserve Price
A new reserve price feature has been added to the system. Again this is set
up in the animal type settings in the installation menu. If you say Yes in the
reserve field in the animal types it will prompt you for a reserve price when
pre-booking items.

VAT
For clients that have agreed to use standard cheque and bill stationary it is
possible to take advantage of being able to set up any animal type to be either
vatable or non vatable, this is particularly useful for clients that sell furniture or
implements through the market system, or any other vatable items. This is
also set up in the animal types program in the installation menu. It is also the
fourth page, as above with the reserve and set price features. If you have
standard stationary and are interested in using this facility we may need to
make some changes to your cheque and bill program. If you do not have
standard stationary this facility is not available.

BCMS
If markets scan all their tags then in the installation set Email BCMS to "N"
then when the passport is scanned the software knows it's a new passport
and flags the transaction for emailing to BCMS.

Turnover Analysis
Now allows for up to 50 different animal types per section

Lot Entry
In the box input part you are no longer prompted for Animal Type but this can
be altered by the line amendment.

SAMU
Scotland only. Now shows the invalid flock no's in red and these can be
amended by D/clicking on the red cells in question.

New End of Market Reports

There is a separate set of instructions included to provide a detailed
explanation for this, but basically it gives the user the ability to print the report
to a printer of their choice and to not have to print loads of unwanted reports.
It also gives the user the ability to print historical reports (only starting from
when they first get this software).

Additional End of Market Report
There is a new end of market report for sage users. It will post the market
totals to sage. If you do not use sage please make sure that this option is set
to N in the installation menu, in option 10 End of Market Reports to Print. Set
Post Market Totals to Sage to N for No.
Salering2000 Bug Fixes and alterations
      There was a bug with reselling lots in the salering program. This
      created duplicate lots. This bug has been fixed in the latest version.

      Salering2000 - Changing Sections
      1. Option to change selling section without having to exit back to the
      desktop and re load the program again. If you click on the End button
      on the Enter Next Lot number form you will get a prompt to 'Change
      Sections Y/N". If you say Y to this you get the setup screen appear so
      that you can select a different market or section and the program will
      run on from there. If you say N you get the normal exit salering Y/N
      option.

      Salering2000 - Reselling Lots
      2. If you bring up a lot that has already been sold then when you go to
      sell the current lot you get the price and the purchaser from the sold lot.
      Markets have been finding this confusing and I have removed this now.

      3. When the message box appears saying this lot has already been
      sold you now get the lot number, price, eartag and purchaser so you
      know exactly which lot you are saying Yes to.

       Salering2000 – Enter Remarks
      4. You can now enter remarks for the lot that you are entering the price
      for. If you press F4 you can enter the price for the lots on the main
      screen and if you press SHIFT + F4 you can enter remarks for the lot
      that you are currently selling.

Extra Deductions
This program has been updated into a more contemporary windows type
program, with mouse functionality. It is quicker and easier to use and has the
added functionality of being able to add a minimum and maximum price
against the deduction.

Market Names and Holding Numbers
This program has been updated into a more contemporary windows type
program, with mouse functionality. It provides the ability to hold more
information about the market, such as the market address which is used for
the Sheep Movement Licences. It also provides the user with the ability to turn
off certain lot booking questions like, field rep and batching. Saying No by
putting an N against them and pressing F5 to save, will stop the questions
being asked when entering lots.

Prebook Lots
No longer asks for salering number if answer to Terminal in Salering is No.

Credit Cards
Some markets are beginning to accept credit card payments. Newline have
developed a program to deal with this. It is a chargeable facility, please call for
details if you are interested.

New Stock Analysis
Newline have developed a new rapid searching archive database that almost
half of our clients have already purchased and are making keen use of to
procure stock by effective targeting of customers. This program is flexible and
provides accurate records of who buys or sells what, in what quantities and
for what price and when. It provides crucial information for stock procurement
and is helping improve efficiency when searching for specific stock types, and
breeds. It is being continually improved and developed, below are a number
of brief bug fixes or enhancements.

v1.1.18
- added heads and turnover to Nontrading report
- added sections on printout
 - fixed purchaser side analysis.
 - added buyername to Groupby Buyer drilldown
 - (fixed bug in DisplayQueryResultsInGrid in the customer address expansion
code)
 - added CheckRowHeights

- fixed bug in RepReport where gross totals were being overwritten in the grid
by the period totals!
 - Enlarged tablesarray
 - fixed layouts of history report printouts (changed to right align)

New Contact Management
Clients using the new archive database have the option of buying a contact
management system that lets them record customer calls and produce reports
with follow up dates.

New Fieldsman/Rep Report
In the During the Sale menu, select the Market Reports option, then pick Rep
Reports. This program is used to assign reps to lots that they have procured.
This information can then be used for management purposes and commission
reasons.

Movelot
This program is used to produce catalogues for pre-entered sales. It can be
used to transfer lots from one sale to another if they have not been sold. It can
be used create an upload file to book sales onto www.auctionmarts.com . This
program has been altered to print the age of animals in months and days and
not just months. It is also altered so that if the user does not want to print the
vendor's name or address then everything moves over to the left. There is a
new print routine being used so it can be printed to any network printer.

Lot Deletion Bug
There was a bug that caused duplicate lots on the purchaser side if there was
already an invoice and the lot was deleted in the lot deletion program, it would
take the lot off the vendor side but not the purchaser side, this is now fixed.
