DEFRA BREED CROSS REFERENCE WITH NEWLINE BREED LIST

To amend the DEFRA passport breed cross reference with  the  Newline  cattle
breed descriptions select the  following  menu  options.  If  you  scan  the
bottom barcode from the cattle passports in lot entry and the breed  is  not
automatically entered for you, it is possible that the DEFRA  breed  is  not
cross referenced with the Newline breed description.
