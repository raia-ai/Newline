NAS Printing

Scope

Scope may be used to set a system wide default. Therefore, if there is one invoice printer at your site, one setting may be set so all users will use that printer. It is not necessary to setup on a per user basis. This is more efficient than the previous per user setup method.

It is however possible to setup per user if users require different printer settings. It is flexible to suite site requirements.

Font Bold

Makes the print font bold.

Print Preview

Will preview the print output so the user may see what it will look like before it prints.

Tray

The user may pick which tray they want the NAS print job to default to. This feature means the printer need only be setup once in windows as NAS will be aware which tray to select.

Overlay

The user can browse and select a jpg to provide a company logo for the printout.
