Under the commission percentage column the user will see and may change the % commission charged to the seller per lot on the hammer price. In the example above 1.6% is being charged to the seller. The system also enables the user to apply a minimum and maximum charge. In this example 5.95 per head minimum and 15.00 per head maximum.

The system also lets the user apply an entry fee or toll if they wish to.

The user may edit these by clicking F2.

Click save to save and the system gives the user options to apply just to this sale \ office \ day or to all sales.

Sliding Rate Commission :

There are more advanced commission structures for instance a sliding rate system.

It is possible to charge different rates depending on the final value of the lot. In the example above a minimum of 2.00 per head is set on lots valued between 3.00 and 15.00. 3.00 per head of lots valued between 15.01 and 25.00 and so on.

The settings are user changeable and as such Newline does not take responsibility for incorrect commission settings. The onus is on the user to ensure they are satisfied the commission rates are correctly set and checked by them (even if they have requested Newline make the change on their behalf to help them).
