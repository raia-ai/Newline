Select the seller




To pay out by cash click A for all cash.




The screen shows which of the sellers lots that have been sold have been paid for by the buyers (paid
column). Note one of the sold lots does not have Yes in the paid column. This will trigger the warning
message and let the user make their mind up whether to pay out just the lots that have been paid for
or not pay out anything until they are all paid for.




The payment appears as Cash Adv.

                                                                                          1|Page
Select P to print.

The user is asked have they paid the seller the cash yes or no?




Click the appropriate answer.

If the user says yes no credit is posted to the ledger it is assumed you have given the seller the cash, if
they say no a credit will be posted to the sales ledger when the sale is closed, i.e. the seller is still owed
cash for the goods sold. The total of these figures is shown at the bottom left of the list of cheques.




When you go back into the seller statement lots flagged with a X (in the Flag column) have been paid
out to the seller using individual statement method. They will be flagged with a Y if a statement run
has been produced.
