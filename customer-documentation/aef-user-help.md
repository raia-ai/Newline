The user will see a list of collections, ordered by date and split  down  by
centre. Before animals can be exported an  official  CSC1  (Common  Schedule
and Clearance) document must be sent to the AHO  (Area  Health  Office)  for
them to ok the export of these animals.  The  report  has  a  column  titled
CSC1’ Printed, if this column has a different  number  from  the  number  of
heads column the row will be coloured light blue  and  the  user  will  know
they still need to print some CSC1’s. Double click  the  cell  in  the  CSC1
column to view the CSC1.

The user will see the bookings for that collection date that have not had  a
CSC1 printed. Click the preview  tab,  then  click  the  ‘Convert  to  Word’
(Email) button. This will then convert it into Word format.

EMAIL Document
When its finished converting the document it  will  tell  you  the  location
it’s saved (c:\aef\****.doc). You will then need to attach this  CSC1  along
with the others forms and send to the AHO centre in Carlisle.  (your  emails
have been setup on the main server, outlook express icon  on  the  desktop).
You can also print the CSC1 from word.

When the CSC1 is printed/converted a flag is set in  the  database  to  this
effect. The Export Report figures will  change  at  this  point  to  reflect
this. Now there will be animals in  that  row  that  are  Not  Approved  for
export. To view the Not Approved list and approve  them  when  the  CSC1  is
returned by the AHO with  passes  double  click  on  the  cell  in  the  Not
Approved column. The user is shown a list of CSC1s that are relevant to  the
collection centre and date.

[pic]

Each CSC1 has a unique number on it. A Common Support Certificate No in  the
header. Double click the cert no that  matches  the  document  the  AHO  has
faxed back to you.

[pic]

You will see the Not Approved list. It will appear in  the  same  order  you
sent it and you need to tick the ones that have  been  returned  as  passed,
check it is all right and click save. These animals are then  moved  in  the
Approved column in the export report. You then need  to  confirm  these  are
going to the right collection date.

Double click the cell in the Approved column.
