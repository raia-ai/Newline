                                Batching 2000
                             For 32-bit Windows


  Newline ASP Batching 2000 provides the very latest Windows technology to
                         assist with your batching.

                             Features such as:-

                                 ReBatching
                          Move Lots between Batches
                      Completely Automatic EID Batching
                          Next Lot Number searching
                     Instant access to Batch Information


  The first screen is to let the user choose the appropriate market and the
                   section. Complete these and click NEXT

    This screen allows the user to find a vendor by name or number. A new
   feature here is that the user may type in a lot number instead. At this
   point the F1 box will change to Find Lot No.  The appropriate vendor is
                          automatically displayed.

                                  Figure 1.

   F2 will allow the user to batch all lots individually otherwise all the
    lots for the particular vendor are displayed as below. See Figure 2.

   To batch animals simply click the lots to be batched and Click Batch or
                                  press F1.

 If EID is being used simply click F6 before and after a batch goes through
 the reader. The user may also choose to unbatch and rebatch. Note the NewB1
  and NewB2 boxes at the top of the screen. Clicking on these will show the
                contents of each batch. See figures 4 and 5.
