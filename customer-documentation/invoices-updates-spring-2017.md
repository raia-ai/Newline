Buyer Invoices

Introduction

This document provides an overview of enhancements in NAS to the buyer invoice program during the last quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2017.

Grid Font-Size

Each user logged into NAS (providing they log on with different user accounts) may set the default font size for the grids used to display the seller names and seller lot details. This feature makes the screen easier to read at some of the higher screen resolutions on new kit.

e.g. Font size 8

Font size 12

Charges

This feature has been updated and enhanced to perform auto calculations on a per head basis and / or on a per kilo basis. It also removes the need to put a + in front of the charge amount. When the user enters 25 in the charge amount text box the system automatically adds the + symbol in the total textbox in the buyer invoice program.

Note – using a negative sign (manually entered) in the total box the user can generate a return cheque from the system. An example of why you may want to do this is to create a change cheque to your own company to get a float payment from the bank.

Per Head

The user may enter a per head charge and the system will work out the full charge.

The user has entered 15 into the charge per head textbox and the system has calculated the full charge at 60 as there were 4 heads. The user clicks the apply button to accept the charge.

Per Kilo

The user may enter a per kilo charge and the system will work out the full charge.

One-Sided Invoice

The one-sided invoices appear in the list of invoices with a quantity of zero.

Pay Out Other Deductions

Tech Setup required (PAYOUTOTHERDEDUCTIONS sys key) – talk with Newline tech support if you would like to use this feature and it isn’t configured.

A cheque may be produced or BACs to pay the haulier directly.

List of invoices

Buyer Summary

This option will provide sight of all invoices for the buyer, including sub accounts and may be used to see what the buyer owes for all accounts on the day.

Sheep Licence – ARAMs postal address change

The correct postal address for ARAMs on sheep licences in England will show in this version.

Emailing – pdf advice

NAS currently sends seller and buyer paperwork output as a pdf attachment when emailing. Recently there have been reports that some auction clients have found it difficult to open the attachments. Certain pdf readers will not open the attachments and view them as viruses. Our advice currently is to use adobe reader and open the pdf with that. It is possible to add a sentence to this effect in the email signature which may reduce calls from your customers saying they can’t open their copy statement or copy invoice. @yahoo addresses seem to be particularly prone to this.

Buyer cheques

Some clients use menu option 4 in the buyers reports menu to record cheque details from buyer payments in case the cheque bounces and they need to look up the details.  There is now an option in history to get this information after the sale has closed.
