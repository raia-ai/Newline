Intro:

Newline’s definition of a contra is when a seller is owed money and they are also a buyer who owes money, or they have an old debt on the system they may wish to contra one value off against another.

Buyers Side:

If the buyer has sold at the sale as well as bought you will see a contra option in red.

Select C for contra and the system automatically calculates how much you can take off the invoice.

Click F5 to save. The contra will appear on the invoice printout.

Sellers Side:

If you’ve added the contra on the buyers invoice side when you go into the sellers cheque you will see the contra applied already.

Alternatively if you prefer you can add the contra to the seller cheque side first, rather than the buyers invoice side. If you do Q for cheque it will show you if the seller bought today.

The user may select C for contra

They can then select the line they wish to pay off.

It will then show what is being paid off and what is left on the cheque.

Reports:

If you have show payments by contra ticked (a per workstaion / user setting in the options menu) you will get the contra payments shown in the list of invoice report.

This appear under the paid by column.

With totals available at the bottom of the report.

There is also a report on the seller side. The list of cheques. It has a contra column if a contra has been done.

Sale Close Report

Before you can close the sale the control report must balance. This report shows any contras you’ve done for sale day debt and old debt.
