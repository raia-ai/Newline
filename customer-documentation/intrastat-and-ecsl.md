ABOUT INTRASTAT
Quick guide to Intrastat


Intrastat is the name given to the method of collecting information and producing
statistics on the movement of goods between Member States of the European Union
(EU).
Please note: Intrastat should not be confused with EC Sales lists which are used to
collect information on all sales from UK VAT registered traders to VAT registered traders
in other EU Member States.
The flowchart below explains how Intrastat works. The words in bold text on the chart
are key areas and are explained more fully by clicking on the appropriate button on the
right of the chart.

Intrastat in NAS
NAS has the facility to record Intrastat details and submit these online for you. Go into the Add-ins
menu and click the Intrastat link.




When you close a sale in NAS details will be posted and available for you to complete in the Intrastat
module in NAS. All goods imported into the UK for sale by European sellers will be shown as arrivals.
All goods for export out of the UK will be shown as dispatches. Intrastat is normally reported a
month at a time. The example below shows July (month 7) in 2013. The lot no, customer number,
terms and NOTC (Nature of Transactions) are pre-populated for you. You then need to enter the
commodity code.




Reporting your EU sales using the EC Sales List (ESL)
If you're a VAT-registered business in the UK that supplies goods and certain services to a VAT-registered
customer in another European Union (EU) country, you'll have to tell HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)
about the supplies.
You need to complete an EC Sales List (ESL) showing details of each of your customers in the EU and the
value (in sterling) of the supplies you've made to them in the period. If you haven't made any supplies (or
issued any credit notes) you should not submit an ESL and the ESL Online service (ECSL) will not allow
you to submit a nil declaration.

This will be automatically collated for you when the sale is closed. You are able to export a file and
upload it to the ECSL website.
