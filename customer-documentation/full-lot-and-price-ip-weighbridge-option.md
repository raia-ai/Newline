Intro

Many markets sell sheep through the ring using the full lot and price option in NAS. Finished sheep sales that are weighed may have the lot information automatically passed from the weigh bridge indicator to the clerk in the ring.

Setup

The mart requires an IP configured weigh bridge (conforming to a Newline standard for data format).

The IP address of the weighbride unit must be entered into NAS.

The IP address is added for the appropriate device in the correct salering. In the example above there is a media player TV display and a weighbridge in ring 2.

Within the sale

Ensure these settings are ticked on the rostrum laptop.

Tick the section and click in Name or No. The system when set to work with weighbridge will automatically move to the next screen. It doesn’t expect the user to enter a seller at this point.

Note you must have the correct salering number selected.

Scales

The drover will press F1 on the scales to start. The enter the lot number and press enter. Then enter the vendor ID (The Newline code) for example R55 and press enter. The drover will need to know these details. The mart must have a system in place to ensure this information is available to the drover. The drover then enters the qty in the lot. Then presses the print or F4 key to send the detail to the clerk in the rostrum.

Clerk

The clerk will see the weight and lot number appear in the grid in the bottom right of the screen.

The lot and qty details and vendor remain blank until the clerk presses the F10 key to move the details from the scales and the weights to process grid to the lot textboxes.

Sell the lot as normal.
