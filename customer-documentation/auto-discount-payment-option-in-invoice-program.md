          New Auto Discount Payment Option in Invoice Program.

There is a new feature in the latest Invoice program to automatically allocate any unpaid amount as
discount if the value of the amount is less than 1.00 and there is a payment type in the list of
payment types called Discount.

In the below example the payment amount by cheque is not for the full invoice amount which leaves
.43 outstanding.




When the user presses RETURN to confirm the amount being paid the system will then automatically
allocate the .43 as Discount as there is a Discount payment type set up in the list and display the
following screen.
You will see if the above the .43 has been allocated as Discount and the invocie is showing as paid in
full.

If you do not have a payment type set up as Discount then when making payments on the system
and the value of the outstanding amount after the first payment type is entered you will see the
normal screen as per the below.




This shows the .50 as still outstanding and you then have to enter another payment type and
amount.
