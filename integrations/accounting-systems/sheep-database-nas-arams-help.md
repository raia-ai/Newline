NAS & ARAMS (Animal Reporting and Movement Service)



Background
DEFRA have commissioned South Western to develop and deploy a national sheep movements
database to be live and operational by 1st April 2014. All English markets are by law required to report
all sheep movements through this database (this does not apply to Welsh or Scottish marts who have
alternative systems). The system is called ARAMS (Animal Reporting And Movement Service) / a.k.a
Aphis England and general information is available at this website.

http://www.arams.co.uk/

Newline’s NAS product has been updated to integrate with the ARAMS system. These legislative
changes are FOC to all elite support customers and available to standard support customers as a
chargeable system add-on. Please contact pc@newlineasp.com for cost information.

What Sheep must be recorded?
All sheep must be recorded. Markets must attempt to electronically record every animal. Animals with
plastic tags must have a flock number identifier loaded into the system to match the number of sheep
at market (please refer to the LAA for clarification on recording batch within batch).

What has changed in NAS?
System Configuration – Setting up an office



The office configuration screen has been completely updated to enable the user to specify which
country the market is located in. See the drop down options under location. All marts operating in
England will need to select England from the list (this is the cross reference that later loads up the
appropriate form for sending movements to ARAMS). Selecting England is done by clicking the F2
button or pressing the F2 key and clicking the drop down combo and selecting England (highlighted
below).




The user also needs a unique username, password and token number set up against each market.
See made up example below.

South Western should send you these security details directly.

This new screen also let’s mart administrator users setup new sales without needing to call Newline.
Using the Copy to New Office feature.




The user selects the sale they wish to make a copy of.

Users must select the type of market they are running. Is it a green market (for stores) or a red market
(for slaughter)?

Lot entry




The home bred tick box should be ticked if the sheep are from flock of birth and you do not intend to
read each individual tag (as they only have a batch tag). If this is ticked it will record the flock number
automatically against the lot so the user does not have to manually add this information into the pen
reading system. Please see notes on entering quantities of manual tags.

The holding and postcode details in the yellow frame come from the customer account. If the stock
has come from a different holding the user can enter the alternative holding no, postcode in the yellow
frame for that one lot.

Note the holding number and postcode shown in the yellow frame must agree with the holding
number and postcode stored on the national sheep database. If one is empty or both are empty, or
incorrect, or do not match the information stored on the national sheep database the movement will
fail. It is up to the user to ensure this information is correct. Newline cannot assist in this matter as
they do not have access to the correct records. The market user will need to check with the seller and
if it still causes problems check with South Western to find out what is recorded on the national sheep
database.

This example is no good. The holding number is invalid and will fail and there is no postcode.

This example is no good. There is no postcode.




On Movements




Wrong menu option. This menu is shown if the market location is not specified as England. The initial
setup is not correct. The menu below will be shown if the market location is set to England.




This is the menu needed for the sending movements to the UK Sheep database from 1st April 2014.

Click file and send on market movements to send the movements.

The reply column will show the reply. If it is ok, there is nothing further to do and the movement has
been successfully transmitted to the national database. If it is fail the user may double click it to view
the reason.




Here are some typical fail examples and recommended solutions.

No Postcode entered = fail




Solution = enter correct postcode in the postcode cell and send again.

Invalid Holding No = fail




Double click the fail cell to see the reason returned from the national database.

Solution = enter correct holding number in the holding number cell and send again.

Postcode & Holding Number in NAS do not match those stored on the national database = fail

Solution = double check the details you have stored in NAS. You may need to speak to the seller and
confirm there is no mistake in either holding no or postcode. If you have the same details they gave
you, then you will need to check with the national sheep database what they have stored on their
system. Newline cannot help fix this error. The data has to match the national sheep database (contact
them directly).




Manual Eartag Input

Click on the manual input button.




If the user enters a 7 digit flock number the “Enter number of batch tags required” box appears. The
user enters the number of sheep with this batch and presses the ok button. These details are then
stored against the lot and other batch tags may be recorded in the same lot if necessary.

The pen reading software shows the tags that will be sent. This picture shows 5 batch tags in pen 1
(these tags were created by the user ticking home bred single batch tag option in the pre-entry
process.

Many of Newline’s users are moving away from EID download sticks to a more flexible, dynamic
solution. The new Toughpad is proving very robust and popular for this task because it allows
manual tag input at the point of reading. Contact pc@newlineasp.com for details.

Invoicing
When invoicing you can check if all the EID tags have been read. The picture shows 5 tags in yellow
which agree with the heads total of 5.




The postcode is now visible on the movement form. The holding no and postcode shown here must
agree with the ones stored on the national database. If there is no holding number stored on the
customer account they must complete the details at this point. If the destination holding number and
postcode is different from the one stored on the customer account the user must enter the correct
destination holding number and postcode which must agree with what is stored on the national
database.
