UPGRADE W150 TO W255


ENSURE ALL VENDOR ARCHIVING IS UP TO DATE, (THIS IS THE  LOT  ENTRY  &  SALE
DATA).

MAKE SAFE COPIES OF ALL DIRECTORIES/FOLDERS.

FROM THE MASTER MARKET DIRECTORY RUN HEAD255.EXE,  (THIS  UPDATES  THE  HEAD
FILE AND INCREASES THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS FROM 150 TO 255).

E.G.  C:\MARKET>\UTILITY\HEAD255.EXE
[THIS IS VERY QUICK AND WILL RELAY: OPERATION COMPLETE. PRESS (RETURN)].

RENAME THE ARCHIVE DIRECTORY E.G. OLDARCH
MAKE A  NEW  DIRECTORY  CALLED  ARCHIVE  AND  ANOTHER  CALLED  ARCHIVE2  FOR
EXAMPLE, WITH ALL THE OLDARCH DATA IN THEM. THIS MUST BE DONE ON A  WIN  311
PC. ARCDRIVE MUST BE IN THE OLDARCH DIRECTORY.  IF  IT  IS  NOT   THE  ERROR
“STOP IN LINE 40210 OF MODULE ARC255” WILL APPEAR.

RUN ARC255.EXE FROM THE WITHIN THE OLDARCH DIRECTORY. MAKE SURE THAT  THE  C
DRIVE IS LOGGED ON AS C:> & NOT C:\WINDOWS, ELSE  THE  ERROR  STOP  IN  LINE
40210 WILL OCCUR.

E.G.  E:\OLDARCH>\UTILITY\ARC255

WHEN PROMPTED FOR “ENTER NEW DRIVE”  TYPE  IN  THE  DRIVE  LETTER  THAT  THE
ARCHIVE DATA IS ON AND A COLON, PRESS ENTER.

WHEN PROMPTED TO “ENTER NEW DIRECTORY”  TYPE  IN  ARCHIVE2  (THIS  DIRECTORY
WILL HAVE THE TRANSACTIONS UPDATED IN IT TO THE  NEW  NUMBER  OF  CHARACTERS
WHEN THE PROGRAM RUNS). WHEN THE PROGRAM COMPLETES SUCCESSFULLY THE STOP  IN
LINE 400 OF MODULE ARC255 MESSAGE APPEARS.

THEN COPY EVERYTHING FROM OLDARCH  INTO  ARCHIVE,  AND  COPY  ARCHIVE2  OVER
ARCHIVE.

EDIT DEBTDIR TO THE NEW 255 FORMAT
CHECK ARCDRIVE; TAGARC; TAGDRIVE; POINT TO THE CORRECT LOCATIONS.

RUN MAKSECNU.EXE FROM  THE  ARCHIVE  DIRECTORY.  PRODRIVE  MUST  BE  IN  THE
ARCHIVE DIRECTORY, ELSE “FILE NOT FOUND  IN  LINE  20  OF  MODULE  MAKSECNU”
ERROR. DEBTDIR MUST BE IN IT ALSO OTHERWISE “FILE NOT FOUND IN  LINE  22  OF
MODULE MAKSECNU”

WHEN PROMPTED TO “ENTER YEAR TO RE-INDEX ie 95?” DO SO. WHEN IT IS  DONE  IT
WILL SAY “RE-INDEXING COMPLETE (RETURN) FOR SYSTEM?”

THE END OF MARKET REPORTS WILL CRASH IF OTHERDES &  EXTRADES  FILES  DO  NOT
EXIST. THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR MKNAMES.NOM
