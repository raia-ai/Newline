                        Deployment for NI Markets



Programs:

The following programs will need to be sent to all NI markets:

GovServices (see separate document)

BALANCE.EXE

NASBEND.EXE

NIFAISLOGIN.EXE (and dependent bits – add detail here)




(will add minimum versions after final testing)




The menu options and the results screens in the system are the same as before, it’s just
some of the progress screens will look slightly different when sending.
