I am planning on sending this out to all our users tomorrow to give them a
quick first look at the new taginp program and see what their initial views
are on this. Is there anything you want to add to this?

I plan on doing the same with the new prebooking screen also but this will
take a little longer as there are a lot more options and features in this.





New Market Software. Feb Update

As some of you will be aware we are currently in the process of altering
the pre entry and ear tag input programs on the market system. The new
screens will give the user a lot more flexibility in the way that they can
load lots on to the system. I have attached below a snap shot of the new
Tag Input screen for you to have a look at and a brief overview of how we
see this working. If you have an comments or suggestions on the new screen
and how it will work then please let me know and we will see if these can
be included in this version.

Operation
The user can select one or more sections from the sections across the top
of the screen. This can be achieved by using the mouse to click on the
required section or my pressing the SPACE BAR to tick the section required.
You can move from section to section by using the arrow keys. Once you have
selected the section/s required pressing RETURN will take you to the Enter
Lot Number / Vendor input box.

Enter [ Lot Number ] / [Vendor Name or Number] or [RETURN] to list ALL lots
At this prompt it is possible to enter the following.
Pressing RETURN with a blank box will list all transactions pre booked in
the sections selected.
Entering a lot number will display all the transactions matching that lot
number in the sections selected.
Entering a lot number range will display all transactions between and
including the lot numbers entered. It will also look for lot numbers like
300-304 and check to see if the first lot number is between the lot number
range entered.
If you enter a single alpha char you will get a list of customers with lots
entered in the selected sections for you to choose from.
If you enter a customer surname or part of the surname then again you get a
list of matching customers with lots in the selected sections for you to
choose from. If you enter a # between surname and farm
name/initials(depending upon how you have set up the search index) you get
only the customers that match these 2 pieces of information.
Once the selection has been made then the matching transactions will be
displayed in the grid on the screen. The vendor details of the first lot in
the grid will be displayed in the box above the grid to the left. The
details will alter as you move down the grid.

There is a button positioned top left of the grid called Tab Stops.
Clicking this will display the following

This screen allows you the user to select which columns you want the focus
to move to when you press RETURN to confirm data you have entered.
Therefore if you only want to enter ear tag numbers, dates of birth, breeds
and farm assurance details then just tick these 4 tick boxes and the cursor
will move around just these columns. You can however at any time arrow over
to any other columns and enter additional information as required.

As you enter a line of information in to the grid when the program moves
you down to the next line the last line of data is saved to the system.

As you can see from the grid there are some new columns available. You can
now enter a different fabbl number for a lot and this will be stored on
that transaction. You can at this point alter the holding number, movement
date or movement type on a lot by lot basis without having to exit back to
the main screen.

The item type column will display the item type as entered in the pre
booking process but you have the option here to amend this. This column
will display all the item types for the sections selected and you will be
able to amend the itemtype to that of a type in a different section.

There will be a new field in the installation screen so that the system can
be told if an item type is male or female and the system will then check
when scanning the passport if the sex from the passport matches the sex of
that itemtype. If they are different the system will inform the user.

If you go in to this option after the lots have been sold then the screen
will display the weight, price and total price for the lot selected in a
frame in the middle of the screen in line with the vendor details and then
to the right of this the screen will display the purchaser details.

If there is anything that we have left out of this new program or there are
anything that you do not like then please let me know and we will look in
to them.
