Path Not Found Errors in the Market System


This means the program can not locate a required directory such as the
archive, market, tagdir directories.

1. Check that the required directories exist.
2. Check the pointer files like arcdrive, tagarc, tagdrive to see that they
   point to the right directory.
3. Check the pointer files on the route and within any market directories.
