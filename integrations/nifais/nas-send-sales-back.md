Sales can be sent back to HQ at  any  time  as  different  firms  run  their
operation in different ways. Some remote market sites will produce  all  the
invoices and cheques before sending sales back, other will run the sale  and
then send back the sale for the cheques to be produced at HQ.

Select the sale you want to send back to the HQ server.

The user will see the sale details for the sale they have selected  to  send
back and  they  will  see  the  old  sale  details  that  are  going  to  be
overwritten when the sale is sent back.
