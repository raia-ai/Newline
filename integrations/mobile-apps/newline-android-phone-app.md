                              Newline Android Phone App.

This is a contact application that enables you to have your company database on your mobile phone,
to search for a customer and call them, text them or record that you have visited them. If you are
recording a visit then you can enter notes about that visit.

There is an option to view all contacts for the previous 30 days on the phone on a day by day basis
and all of the information is automatically updated back to the Newline NAS CRM system.

Phone App Screen.
When the phone app is installed you should see this icon on your phone.




If you select this icon you then get the below screen.
Search Contacts Option.
To search for a customer press the Search button and you will get an option to search for a customer.
To search for a customer you can enter their account number or their name or part of their address.
The search will search for the name and address in both the name and address fields as the user might
not know how the information has been originally entered. Once the search information has been
entered you will get a list of matching results which look like this.
You can then select the customer you are wanting to contact and you get this screen.
This will display all the phone numbers you have for the customer selected and give you the option to
phone them, text them or record a visit. To call them you just need to press the Phone button on the
left of the screen.

To send them a text message you just need to press the Text button on the right of the screen.

This will display a screen for you to enter a text message and once the message has been entered
there is a send button to send the text.
There is also an option at the top of the phone number list to record a site visit. This will display this
screen.
This allows you to enter any details about the visit and when you made the visit. The system will
default to the current date and time but this can be altered if you are recording visits from a previous
day. You can enter as much information as required in the notes box as it will scroll.



View Activity Log Option.
This will list the last 30 dates with contact information entered on that phone. It will list the details in
date order and show the number of contacts next to each date.
To view the contacts on a particular date you select the date required and you will get a list like this.
This shows the following information.

     Green Notes Icon indicates a visit and the arrow here is always out.


    Green Text Icon indicates a text message and then the up arrow means it was sent from this
phone. If the arrow was down then it would be a text message received by the phone.

     Green Phone Icon means that this is an answered call and again the up arrow means that the
call was made from that phone. A down arrow will mean that this was a call in to the phone.

    Red Phone Icon means this is a missed call and the down arrow indicates that this was an
incoming call not answered by the phone.



If there are … against the activity record then this means that there are notes for that contact. If you
select this record you get the following screen appear.
HQ Report Options.
All of these contact records are automatically sent back to the main HQ server and updated to the
NAS contact Management system. There is a new option on the stock analysis report to enable the
user to view the number of times each buyer and seller has been contacted. This new option is top
right on this screen.
If this new option is ticked then there is an extra column on the below report showing the number of
contacts for each customer between the dates specified.




New Contacts and Stock Analysis Detail Report.
There is also a new more detailed report in the history analysis menu that will give the user the option
to be able to view a summary of the number of heads and total value by date that each customer has
bought or sold and it will also show in detail the contact information. The new report has this opening
screen so you can select to analyse in the same way as the stock analysis report but you can set
different date ranges for the contacts. See below.




This report will then show the value and number of heads sold between the top dates and then the
contact details between the dates in the highlighted boxes. The report looks like this.
This show the date of the sale the number of heads bought and value of stock bought and then the
contact date, contact type and the person that made the contact.
