Special Sheep Sales at Export Assemble Centers

NAS users will need the stand alone EAC software for this operation. This has a separate annual maintenace fee.

The EAC must be set up as EU and Breeding.

The sheep need to be scanned onto the stick into the memory. The user should start at pen 1 and use group A on the stick, pen 2 should be group B and so on. Note each sellers lots need to be scanned and downloaded separately. If the seller has 3 lots scan the 3 lots and go and download. Do not scan multiple sellers together as it will not work.

They take the stick to the laptop or PC to download the tags in this option.

Enter the sellers flock number, permit number and breed, age, sex details. Then click Enter Batch No button. Sellect the batch to download the tag against.

If there are multiple groups A, B, C, etc on the stick the user will see a mutli batch screen and will need to double click the right group to the right pen/batch no.

The from flock Aphis document number and other details are entered by the user and a batch number allocated against the pen or lot details you are downloading from the stick.

Once the sheep are taken off the stick and into the EAC software the user needs to update Aphis with these details. So Aphis know which sheep are on the EAC.

Tick the row to send and click yes. Then click file in the top left and Send details onto EAC to Aphis

This process updates Aphis with which sheep are on the EAC.

Sheep then sold to NI farms will need to be permitted off. For Special Sheep Sales (SSS) this is done through the move non exportable animals off EAC (Note all animals in an SSS are exportable but this is the process to follow for sheep not going to ROI or UK)

Fill in the details and add the batch / pen / lot number to the list to bring the sheep tags through. Click the print permit button followed by the update Aphis button.

This process takes the sheep off the EAC from Aphis point of view. You can see what animal are left by checking the EAC flock list option in the menus.

It will either show you a list of sheep on the EAC or message to say there are none.

Any sheep left on the list after the NI ones have been permitted will be moved off by the Vet using an Aphis online system to export them to ROI or UK. We don’t get involved in that part.
