New Sheep EID Reading Alterations.

Race Reading – Over Reads in a Lot

Delete Tags From Lot

There are now two big labels in the middle of the screen to show the operator the number of eid tags read/entered and also the number of sheep expected in the lot being read.

This is only visible if using one race to read the sheep. If both race grids are visible on screen then this information is not shown and the user will have to use the details under each of the grids.

If the user reads/enters more tag numbers than the number of sheep in the lot the system will display the following information.

If this happens then the last sheep read will be the number at the top of the grid on the left and it is now possible to delete this tag from this lot and then re read this in to the next lot. To delete a tag from the lot you click on the required row so in the above example the user would click on the very top line in the grid. The display will look like this.

Once there is a blue line around the ear tag that you want to delete you press the DEL key and the system will display the following message.

If this is the tag number that you want to delete then click on the Yes button or press Y or arrow to the left on the keyboard and ENTER and this eartag will be deleted from this lot. The screen will then revert back to the following.

Split tags between two lots.

If all tags for two lots have been read in to the one lot there is now an option to split a list of tags read between two different lots. You could use the delete option mentioned above but this is only possible if the list of tags are still in the reading list on the left. If the lot has been ended and then the user realises that the tags read were for two different lots it is now possible to split these. As you can see from the screen below we have read 7 sheep in to this lot but there are actually only 5 in it.

The next lot 119M was supposed to have the extra two that we have read in lot 119.

To split a lot you double click on the lot from the list on the right. This will then display the following.

You then click on the Split Lot option and the screen will show this.

If you select the starting tag number from the list on the left that needs to be moved to the new lot. You can do this by double clicking on the row in the grid. You can see by the date and time read where there is a bigger gap between reads which might help to work out where the split needs to go.

If you double click on the row in the gird on the left the screen will display the following.

You then enter the lot number as per the above screen (I entered Lot Number 119M) and click on update.

This has now updated the main race reading screen as per the below.

It has amended the original lot 119 to 5 reads now instead of 7 and added a new row to the grid for the new lot 119M. You will then see that there are two lots 119M in this grid one for the original lot that we did not read any tags and then the new 119M which has been created by the splitting of lot 119. This will show as one lot and one set of reads in the main system.

Moving all Tags Read from one lot to another.

As you can see from the screen below we have read all these 10 tags in to lot 252 but now find out after they have been read that the lot number should be 352.

To amend the lot / pen number you double click on the required row in the grid on the left of the screen and you will get the following screen.

So instead of splitting the lot between two different lots we want to move all the tags in this lot to a different lot. You enter the new lot number in the input box on the screen so in our example we enter 352 here.

We then press ENTER to this and ENTER or CLICK on update and the computer will update the details to the new lot number and display the information on the main race reading screen as below.
