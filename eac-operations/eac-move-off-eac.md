Intro:

Some animals moved onto the EAC are not moved off for export and needed to be moved back out of the EAC. This document explains how to do this.

Fill in the flock details and address of where the sheep are going back to.

Either get the batch tags from a batch on yous system by entering the batch number and clicking the add to list button.

This will add the tags for the permit to the grid at the top left of the screen.

Or download them from the EID stick or manually type them.

Click print permit. This will then print the permit out for you. The update aphis button will become enabled and you should click it to send the information to Aphis.

Tech:

If you get an error message back run the utility menu option (clear old data) and try the process again.

View Flock List:

This option shows a user which sheep are on the EAC accroding to Aphis.

Once the animals are movedf off the EAC in menu option 7 they should no longer appear in the EAC flock list.
