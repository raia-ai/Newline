NAS clients will sometimes know which lots coming into the auction are going into a particular sale, but not know what final lot number order they want to sell them in. There is a sale lot number re-order option in NAS to faciliate this.

There is a warning to users so that sales that do not want to be re-ordered are not.

If you want to sort the sale in the way the lots have been entered. Type E and press the ok button.

The system will prompt which lot number to start at. Enter the starting lot number and click ok.

Alternatively you may wish to short the lots based upon itemtype and sub group. Type S for sort.

Select the sort by order.

Enter the first lot number in each group.

Click the sort tick boxes for the lot ranges you want to sort and click the next button.

If you wish to move lot numbers around within a sub group you may highlight them by clicking them. Then right click on a non highlighted lot that you want to move the seleted lots before.

Click ok and the lots will move order.

When you move the lots around you will see the old lot no and the new lot order. If you are happy with the order click update lot no and click save.
