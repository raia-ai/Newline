Intro:

Newline have done further work on the NAS interface integration to the online GAP and saleroom.com system which should reduce duplication of work and give you time savings. Please call so we can agree a convenient date to install and configure the update for you.

The additional information in the new file format includes the lot estimate split out into separate fields so it imports directly into the online platform. This saves you from having to enter these details in two places.  It also fills in the section description for you.

You get this screen when you select the GAP option in the NAS catalogue creation menu.

This will let you enter the lot number range for the different section descriptions. These then show up on this part of GAP.
