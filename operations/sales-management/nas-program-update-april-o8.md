Overview of this UK update

Newline constantly develop and improve their products,  making  use  of  the
latest technologies available and dealing with current  and  new  challenges
facing the livestock industry. Newline is fortunate to have  a  client  base
which is keen to move forward and often recommends tweaks  and  improvements
to the system and we take these on board.

Sometimes Newline is fairly criticised for not documenting  the  changes  we
make or introducing new bugs to the system when we  send  out  mass  changes
and bug fixes. We have been listening to you and this update is intended  to
change this perception and improve things for all of us. Newline has  needed
a method of distributing fixes and updates to clients on  a  regular  basis,
with information about the updates but has not had a straightforward  method
for doing this until now. We now have  an  internet  program  updater  which
will allow us to post updates for you to be able to pick  them  up  at  your
convenience, with a detailed description of what they will do.

This update will allow us to install our updater  and  tell  you  about  it.
Please see details below of changes to the NAS system.

The Tab Stops button lets a user set the flow of data in  the  cattle  input
grid. Whichever tick boxes the user selects determines how the  cursor  will
move from cell to cell after the enter key is pressed on the keyboard.
[pic]

Enter TB Test dates

Some users have been putting test dates in the remarks fields, there is  now
a dedicated field for TB Test dates that you can enter in the  cattle  entry
grid.
[pic]

Change Vendor Holding Number Easier
Some users prefer to use the keyboard to the mouse at all times.  Especially
pedigree cattle sales have a requirement to change the  holding  number  for
the vendor regularly.  Newline  have  introduced  an  option  to  make  this
easier.

In the  Options  Menu  select  Screen  Prompts  and  Prompt  for  Holding  /
Assurance Details. If this option is  ticked  when  you  pre-book  the  lots
after entering the item type and pressing enter the  focus  will  move  into
the holding number box.

[pic]

Press enter to move from box to box until you get back  to  the  lot  number
box.

[pic]


[pic]

Enter the section number and press enter in the white box bottom  right,  or
if you prefer the mouse click the section tick box and  click  the  Continue
button.
[pic]

[pic]

The user is presented selling options. Usually these are preset and  correct
so the user can just press the enter key as it is  already  focused  on  the
Continue button. If however you wish to sell in guineas  then  tick  it  and
press Continue.
[pic]

[pic]

The user is prompted for the lot number.
[pic]

When they enter it the form is filled out with the vendor  details  and  lot
details.
[pic]

[pic]

Press return through the prompts and add remarks  and  so  on  if  required.
Enter the weight (if needed) price and purchaser.
[pic]

[pic]

[pic]

A Sheet Running total is kept. Balance after each sale sheet  and  press  F4
to rest the running total back to 0 for the start of the next sheet.
[pic]

Press the F3 key to see unsold transactions.
[pic]

[pic]

Ewes & Lambs

[pic]

Different marts tend to sell these in different ways. The unit total is  the
multiplier. Therefore if you had 2 ewes and 4 lambs sold  at  £50  per  head
this example would multiply it by 2. If you just wanted to sell  the  entire
group as a single unit you would show it as below

[pic]

Splitting Cows & Calves

[pic]

If you want to sell the cow separately to the calf then untick the calf  and
sell the cow. Then sell the calf you will see

[pic]

If you wish to sell it on its on and not part of the cow & calf  unit  press
Yes.

[pic]

Enter the section number and press the enter key or click the tick box.
[pic]

Enter the vendor name or account number and press enter.
[pic]

Enter the item type and press enter, and the lot number.
[pic]

Enter through the form and type in the details you need to.
[pic]

Display Board Option:
Newline’s Salering program works with over 40 different  display  board  and
TV type boards. Not all our clients will want  to  use  this  full  lot  and
price input option to display lots on the  screen, but  for  those  that  do
please get in touch and we will look  to  configure  it  for  your  type  of
board.

[pic]

The user has seached for lot 1. In this example they have a lot one  in  the
cattle and a lot one in the sheep. The Vendor and Purchaser details  at  the
bottom left of the screen relate to the lot with the blue  rectangle  around
it. The cattle lot.
[pic]

When a lot is highlighted with the blue rectangle we’ve added  a  new  label
to show useful information so the user does not have to scroll to  the  left
to see this any more.

[pic]

When an invoice is produced you cannot edit the financial details of  a  lot
unless you cancel the invoice. This was the same  for  the  breed  and  farm
assurance details, but we have changed this so these non  financial  details
may still be amended even if the financial paperwork has been produced.

[pic]

The new sales ledger options which  replace  the  blue  screen  options  are
designed to  work  with  laser  printers  and  move  away  from  dot  matrix
printing. If you wish  to  use  these  facilities  you  will  need  a  laser
printer. Many markets now have these and use them to  produce  invoices  and
cheques, as the printers are much faster, far quieter and the  invoices  can
be produced on standard blank A4 paper  (which  is  far  cheaper  than  pre-
printed continuous invoice stationary).

A batch running total will be recorded and displayed.

[pic]

When the debt is saved the form is unloaded and the  focus  returns  to  the
customer name or number box. If you need to enter another debt for the  same
customer press return, otherwise enter a new number and press return.

[pic]


If you’ve finished the batch press escape or F8. You will see  a  record  of

The NAS Sales Ledger menu has been altered so that now Option 4 looks like
this.
If you select option four you get the following menu.

[pic]

To Calculate Interest on outstanding account you select option 1. This  will
prompt you to enter a starting date. This is the  date  you  want  to  start
charging interest and any transactions still outstanding prior to this  date
will not have interest charged on them. You will then  be  prompted  for  an
end date. Again any transactions with a date newer  than  the  date  entered
here will not get interest charged on them. Therefore if you always want  to
give buyers 2 week credit then always enter an end date 2 weeks  before  the
current date.

You then get prompted for an interest rate to charge and also  the  last  12
different interest rates set on the system.

You then get an option to enter a stock type  to  charge  so  if  you  press
RETURN to this prompt it will charge interest on all customers.

The last prompts are letter to start from and letter to end at.  Once  these
have been entered the program  will  run  through  all  customer  files  and
calculate the interest on outstanding balances.

[pic]

If you select this  option  you  get  the  following  screen  with  all  the
interest calculated in option 1 visible for the user  to  view  /  print  or
amend.

[pic]

You can make alterations to the list of interest charged and then  click  on
the save button to write this away to the file. If you make  alterations  to
the list and click on exit it will prompt you to save before  exiting.  Once
the user is happy with the interest being  charged  you  can  click  on  the
Update Ledger button and this will post the interest charged in the list  to
the sales ledger. It will also at the same  time  create  the  sage  nominal
file for updating Sage.

If the user wants a list of interest charged then  they  can  click  on  the
print button.

Once the interest has been posted to the sales  ledger  the  user  can  then
select the option to print buyer statements. This will print out  statements
for outstanding transactions and will include  the  interest  calculated  in
this routine.

produced. This will be exactly as it was at the time of printing.
