IMPORTANT

The NAS system requires a sale number or week number each  time  a  sale  is
setup and this should be a unique number within each  year.  However  it  is
not enforced by the system and it is possible to use the same  number  twice
which has  knock  on  affects.  Therefore  Newline  have  designed  an  auto
numbering system to make this process easier and trouble free.

From the 1st January 2009 users will not have to enter  a  sale/week  number
when setting up a sale. It will be an automatic incrementing number  system.
You will need to set this up before the New Year!!

Note in General Settings the New textboxes:

Next Sale No & Sale Suffix

[pic]

The Sale Suffix textbox will be blank until  the  user  clicks  the  options
menu and the Configure Sale Suffixes option and cross references the  suffix
to the sale/office.

[pic]

Select the sale/office you want to set a suffix for from  the  list  on  the
far left of the screen. Monday is selected in this example.

When you click the button a tabbed form appears for you to set the suffix.

[pic]

Follow the tips. Double click the row to set the suffix. Remember  to  click
the Sale Days /Sale Type List each time before setting up the  next  suffix.
You may only use a suffix a maximum of 2 times against the sales.

If you have added a sale day/office but not saved  it  before  clicking  the
Configure Suffix Button you will get this warning when you  double  click  a
row in the sale suffix grid.

[pic]

You’ll need to go back save  the  sale  day/office  details  first  and  try
again.

When you double click the suffix row it will amend the number of times  that
suffix is used and populate the suffix text box.

Repeat process by selecting sale day/office from  the  left  hand  list  and
double clicking the suffix grid to set up all  your  sale  number  suffixes.
When you’ve finished click the hide button.

Auto Sale Numbers

For sales from 2009 onwards you should no longer need to add a week number
when setting up sales as this will be done automatically for you. You still
have the option to override this if an issue occurs. Please call us if you
require more information then is list below.

When you go to setup a sale it checks to see if it can see your main
server. If it can’t it warns you and allows you to setup a sale the old way
without using auto sale numbers (enter sale number). Please check with the
auction manager before entering a sale number.









If all ok then it takes you to the ‘enter date box’. All the other options
are disabled until you enter the date. When you enter the date it checks
the database for the relevant auto sale number. To make sure you have
entered the date correctly it will show you the whole date.



Using the auto sale number you no longer see the sale number box.

Once the sale is setup you get all the details of the sale

-----------------------
If an issue occurs then you get a message and the sale number box appears
for you to enter manually
