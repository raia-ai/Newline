Sales Ledger Improvements

Newline have been developing our ledger programs and all of these shown
below are available for beta testing. They have been installed with a
number of clients since the start of 2009 for trials and debugging and can
be installed with sites who want to try the new ledger features. Newline
need to run a utility program to set these options up so please contact us
if they are of interest to you.

and names on the left hand side of the date and max bal figures.

Credit Dockets

There is an option in the invoice menu to print out a credit docket for the
buyer, which they must sign and the mart keeps it. Essentially it is
intended that the person who buys the sheep guarantees payment for them,
even if they are buying it for somebody else.

On each workstation in the invoices program the user will need to ensure
that Options > Printing > Auto Print Credit Documents is ticked, and that
the Credit Document printer is set up. If these are done then when the
invoice is printed an additional page is printed for the credit document.

Prize Awards for Special Shows

For Premier Club members Newline have produced a prize matrix which may be
configured for any number of prizes per class or category and the prize
values stored against each place for each class. The user can then allocate
lots to a given place within each class and a prize money transaction may
be created and cheque produced for the winners. An invoice is produced for
the class sponsor. Separate documentation available for those interested.
