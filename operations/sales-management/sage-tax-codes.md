Sage Tax Codes:

I have spoken to Sage about tax code T1 against the vendors VAT and Pur Xded VAT. They say this is fine. The VAT figure in our nominal posting to 2200 will be the figure added to the VAT return box 1. Using T1 will keep it at the amount we have in our nominal file.

Sage suggests the following attributions for VAT tax code to use:

T0 zero rated transactions
T1 standard rate
T2 exempt transactions
T4 sales to customers in EC*
T5 lower rate
T7 zero-rated purchases from suppliers in EC**
T8 standard-rated purchases from suppliers in EC**
T9 transactions not involving VAT***

Sage Help on Tax Codes:

1.   From the Configuration Editor window, click the Tax Codes tab.

The Tax Codes information appears, listing all the VAT rates currently available for you. The list also shows whether each rate is In Use - included on your Sage 50 Accounts VAT Return, and whether the rate will be used for transactions with EC countries.

2.   Select the tax code you want to amend and click Edit.

The Edit Tax code window appears.

3.   Enter the rate to be applied as a percentage in the Rate text box provided. You should not change this rate if it is an EC Code, as this rate should not apply.

4.   If you want to include this tax code in your software's VAT Return, select the Include in VAT Return check box. Clear it if you do not want to include transactions with this tax code in your VAT Return calculations.

5.   If the rate relates to transactions with EC countries, select the EC Code check box and enter the EC details in the boxes provided. Choose either EC Sales or EC Purchases, then select Goods or Services from the drop-down lists provided. For more information about these selections, please refer to the topics EC sales lists for services , To generate an EC sales list and What are triangular transactions?

If you select the EC Code check box, then select EC Purchases from the drop-down list, a Link To drop-down list becomes active. Use this drop-down list to link to another tax code. For example, you might want T22 to link to T0, T23 to link to T0 and T24 to link to T1.

6.   To use the code for the Reverse charge sales list category, select the Reverse Charge check box. In addition, use the Link To drop-down list to select the theoretical VAT rate to be used on the Sales Invoice/Purchase-related elements of the Reverse Charge.
