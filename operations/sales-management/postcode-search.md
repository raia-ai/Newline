Customer Postcode Search

If the postcode database finder is installed NAS has a new option in the customer edit screen.

If this is ticked when adding a new user the following happens. Having entered the surname and pressed enter on address line 1 the focus is taken to the postcode field.

Enter the postcode and press enter and the address details are filled in and you are taken to address line 1 to enter the premise details (eg House No.) This is a street level postcode search it is possible to purchase a premises level but it costs a little more.

Type in the building no. and return will take you to the Country text box and carry on as normal.
