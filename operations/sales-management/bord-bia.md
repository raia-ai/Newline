Scanning Eartags

When the eartags are scanned NAS communicates with AIM and retrieves details and communicates with Bord Bia to retrieve farm assurance details and store them against the lot(s).

Display Boards

This information can be displayed on display boards of TV’s from the salering program (however because there are so many different board types it is not programmed to work with all boards just the standard ones). It is possible to alter the salering code to show these details but there may be charges for bespoke boards that are not standard.

Which Board does Client have?

If a customer asks if we can display it on their board please find out what board they have.

We need to know this to check the code to see if that type of board already has the code to show Bord Bia details.

Info Displayed

The Bord Bia info is the number of the moves the animal has made during it’s life and the farm assurance status, such as QA (Quality Assured).
