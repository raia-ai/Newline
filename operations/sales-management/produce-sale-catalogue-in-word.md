There is the ability to produce a sale catalogue from NAS into word (providing word is installed on the workstation in use).

There are a number of options for the user to select to determine what and how they wish to print the auction data into a word catalogue.

Tick the options for the data you wish to export from NAS and see in the word catalogue.

The catalogue may be sorted by default by lot number order. Though it is also possible to sort in the order the lots where entered into the system, or by a grade group method.

The simple catalgoue version puts all the selected data into a word document and displays it on the screen. There is very little formatting attemtped by the simple version.

The user is asked if they wish to create the final catalouge run. If they select yes any amendments to the lots in NAS after this point are noted and available in an appendix report to the catalogue.

The extended version offers a more sophisicated auto formatting solution. The data is inserted into a table within word. There are a number of options the user may tick to adjust the formatting.

Print tables outlines may be included or excluded in the word catalogue. Even when not included the outlines are still visible when working on the document. See below.

Users that add groups when pre-booking lots have the choice to put different groups in separate tables if they want to.

The word document is created but not opened automatically. The user needs to browse to the file created.

This shows an example of the lot data in a table in word. The user may edit the content of the table.

Insert rows:

The user may right click in word and insert rows above or below existing lots.

Merge Cells:

The user may wish to merge cells to type in notes or paragraphs between certain lot ranges.

The user may delete cells.

The extended format can take formatted text straight from NAS included bold, coloured, etc.

Split Tables:

If you want to split tables:

Click the layout tab in word, position the mouse in the first row of the new grid and click split table.

Columns in word:

Click the Page Layout tab and select the number of columns you require.
