        Software alterations to Salering2000 as at 8th January 2001.


[pic]


There is a new Auto weigh option for users with the new Avery weighbridge
and software. This option if selected will prompt for the path of the
weight file created by the Avery system. The file that is required is
called NLWEIGHT.TXT.

The back pen system option has been moved under the printer option and the
lot number prompt that was on this first screen has been moved to the
configuration menu. It is on the additional display option menu.

On the configuration menu there is now the option to use two display boards
in the same salering. They will display the same info so should really have
the same number of lines. If the second board is not required then the Not
Installed option should be selected.

The options for the boards are as below.

                         Different display options.

The vendor’s address or postcode can be displayed but not both at the same
time. If you select one of these options then the other option becomes
unselected automatically.

There will also be a display remarks and new passport option but currently
these are not available for selection.

There are also the following additional options on this menu.


















                       Board 5 standard 7-line board.
Display vendor name, vendor address or Postcode.
These will only display for individual animals. They should therefore only
be ticked for Prime Cattle, Calves and any other sections sold
individually. If ticked and selling store cattle then any lot sold
individually will display the vendor’s details on the board.
The layout of the board for single animals with vendor name, address, lot
number and weight selected is:

and weight selected.

and weight selected.

                      Main Selling Screen Alterations.

The next lot number box can now be moved to any position on the screen so
that it does not block the view of the main animal details if selected
before the last lot is sold. If connected to the Avery weighbridge then the
next lot number and weight will automatically come up in this box and the
user only needs to press [RETURN] to display the next lot. If the lot has a
weight already entered then this will be displayed on the screen with the
option to enter a new weight to override any previously entered weight.

The farm assured status is now on a lot by lots basis and displayed on the
screen by a “Y” under the FA heading. On the display board it is indicated
by FA. It therefore is now possible to have farm assured and non-farm
assured lots in the same batch of animals.

All animals are displayed on the computer screen and also the display board
in descending age order.

The next batch box in the bottom left of the screen displays the following
info.
Number of animals in batch.
Batch number
Lot numbers

You can move any lot to the top of the batching box by double clicking on
it. You can delete any batch from the batch box by clicking on it once to
select and then by pressing the Del key.

If you press F11 or click on sold you can still not sell a lot by entering
a price of zero and pressing [RETURN] to the purchaser. You will then be
prompted to confirm sell a zero priced lot, which if you say Y then the
program will carry on but treat the lot as not sold. You will also get
above the price and purchaser boxes a display box with the lot info that
you are entering the price for.

When entering a purchaser’s name and address/initials, if you enter # after
the surname then the computer will use and info entered after the # to
narrow down the search. If you only want to display buyers who have bought
before then if you enter the purchaser’s name followed by B4 e.g. SMITHB4
the computer will only display any purchasers called SMITH who have
purchased in this sale.

All info entered at the point of sale is written away to the SROLL &
Section Letter & Year & Week number. This is then viewable by the ViewSale
program.
