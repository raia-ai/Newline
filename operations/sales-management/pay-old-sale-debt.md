Pay Old Sale Debt

This option enables NAS users to pay off old ledger debts from within a sale even if the buyer does not have an invoice on the day of the sale.

Enter the debtors surname or press return for all debtors or enter the debtors account number and press the return/enter key.

In the abovfe example it will bring back all debtors beginning with an O.

The user is then shown a similar screen to payment of invoices on the day, but there is no option to pay invoices on the day only old ledger debts here.

Enter the debt reference number and press enter

Press enter to confirm amount being paid by default or type different amount and press enter

Press return if you don’t have other debts to pay off for this debtor or enter next reference number to pay off.

Enter the method of payment

Confirm the amount

It may be a different amount if the debtor is using more than one method of payment. i.e. cheque and cash. There will be a receipt printed off with a unique receipt number on it.

The List Of Invoices

Shows a receipt number in a different range to the invoice number. E.g. 90001

Shows the value of the old debt paid off in the old debts column, and shows how it was paid so you can balance at the end of the sale.

Close Sale Report

Shows the total of old debts paid. There are no debts on the day paid in example above, but the example below shows what it looks like if old debts are paid and sale day debts also.

Total Old Debts Paid is the value paid off existing ledger debts. Total Paid Invoices is the amount paid from todays sale. The Total Paid is the combination of both and what you will lodge at the bank.

When is the ledger debt paid off?

The ledger debt is not paid off the ledger until either the sale is closed which will post the debt or the sales ledger update option is run before the sale is closed.

If you do not have this option and want it please contact Newline.

Sales Ledger

See buyers record will look something like this.

There will be a record showing the unique receipt number and value of debt paid off and a record showing the amount paid and how it was paid, along with the sale number it was paid in. In the example above the debtor paid 5000 by cheque and the balance of 2684.91 by cash. If they just pay by one method there will only be the one line to reflect that.
