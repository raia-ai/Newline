CORRIN SALERINGS

DISPLAY BOARD SETTING

In The 3 sale rings/arena  areas at Corrin there are 3 (7 by 30 display
boards). It is the same board in each ring. These are set to com2 (port 1
on the moxa – except on the Lenova (port 2)).

Each sale ring has its own name. Blackwater is the main ring.

Funcheon is the calf and sheep ring.

Owenacurra is the heifer ring.

I’ve set boards.ini to just have the choice of Corrin as all the rings have
the same board and same setting in them.

WEIGHBRIDGE SETTING

There is a globeweigh weighing stainless steel computer in each ring which
is com5 (port 4 on the moxa).

The globeweigh settings are in the Avery 336 option
