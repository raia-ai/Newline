The Batch Form Number relates to unique batch numbers that can be  found  on
pre printed entry forms. This is an optional field.

General Remarks –
This option is a catalogue option. For  instance  it  may  be  said  in  the
catalogue that the vendors lots are all of top quality and from  a  TB  free
farm. This does not want to entered against every lot as it applies  to  the
group of lots and should only be entered once at  the  start.  The  Tab  key
will take you out of the General Remarks box.

The No. of Lots In Section helps in 2 ways.  First  it  means  that  if  you
enter 4 on one workstation, starting from lot 1, the computer  system  knows
that the next lot available is lot 5 if another workstation is  being  used.
It also serves as a safety check to ensure you enter the correct  amount  of
lots. You do not have to enter a choice here.

Enter the Item Type that appears in the list on the right hand side  of  the
screen. The Group choice refers to groups or breeds. For sheep you will  see
sheep breeds, as long  as  you  have  selected  the  right  choices  in  the
Installation Menu in option 2 Groups and Option 11 in the Installation  Menu
– Breeds.

A Reserve price can be entered, as  can  a  short  description  and  a  long
catalogue description.

You are asked if you want to Repeat Lot Details. If you  do  click  Yes,  if
not No.

At any point you can press the F3 key to see a list of the  lots  that  have
already been entered into the section. You can also view  (as  long  as  you
are on a PC with Word2000 or higher) a catalogue in word based on  what  you
have pre-entered.
