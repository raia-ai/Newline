Re: Pc any10.5 modem situation.

Within xp the legitimate drivers for the external modem do not support the
standard hayes control codes,which pcanywhere needs.
What is needed is to force the standard modem settings so that xp uses the
correct codes.
U can do this as follows. Go to add hardware and select modems,then select
user selection not auto.
Select standard modem and add.Although xp knows it already has a modem
attached it will allow u
to add secondary drivers for it.Once this has been done just select
standard
modem which will appear as an option
in pcanywhere properties.Viola!
