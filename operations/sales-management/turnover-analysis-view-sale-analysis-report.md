Explanation of the CP Totals and YTD Totals Figures:

The CP Totals (current period. i.e. the date range entered by the user)

The YTD Totals (year to date – by default this is the calendar year i.e. 1st Jan 2013 – Today’s date).

So in the example above because this client started using NAS on 27th Nov if the date range is set as above the CP and YTD figures are the same.

The CP Total for Gross of €69270.36 is for the CP date range 01/01/2013 – 31/01/2013

The YTD figures above of €169380.85 is for 01/01/2013 – 27/02/2013 (today’s date)
