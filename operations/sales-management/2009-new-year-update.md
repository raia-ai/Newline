Automatic Sale Numbering

This will deal with the  numbering  of  sales  without  the  need  for  user
intervention. No longer will users need to know  what  sale/week  number  it
is, it will be dealt with automatically by the program  (you  will  need  to
setup and cross reference your sales with appropriate sale  suffixes  –  see
separate document about this). This system  will  automatically  begin  from
1st January 2009 onwards.

Quicker Sale Day Invoice Payment Option

Quicker Seller Changing in pre-book lots & full lot & price input


[pic]

Click the F1 button to amend the seller without deleting  the  lot  you  are
working on. This option is particularly handy when you enter and sell  sheep
in the rostrum and don’t always know who the seller is  for  the  first  few
seconds when the sheep come into the ring. It lets you  enter  the  rest  of
the lot details and then alter the seller without losing them.

Improved Copy History Invoice & Cheque Printing


The copy history printing no longer takes the same settings as  the  invoice
or cheque on the sale day, so you no longer need  to  have  2  or  3  copies
coming out when you only want 1 and you can print to any printer.

Input Safety Features in pre-booking, selling pre-booked lots and  full  lot
and price input, and salering


When the user selects  the  section  and  seller  they  see  a  screen  they
normally don’t need to configure, but sometimes people click  the  mouse  by
accident and alter the  settings  without  meaning  to.  This  can’t  happen
anymore as Newline have disabled the tick boxes unless the user  clicks  the
Amend Settings button first.

Salering

The same concept applies in the salering program, occasionally a user  would
accidentally click the per kilo, rather than per head option, or vice  versa
with dire consequences, so Newline have disabled these options  by  default.
To change them the user needs   to  click  the  Edit  Settings  button.  The
options are then enabled and can be amended.

Search for sellers by herd/flock number.

Use the herd number to find a seller. Enter the number and press enter.



User drive mapping interface


Mapping to your servers

         • We can now set your workstations to map to your servers
           automatically when running NAS. This can be switched on and off
           by a market administrator.
