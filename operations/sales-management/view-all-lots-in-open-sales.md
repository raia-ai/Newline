                    NEW VIEW LOTS IN ALL OPEN SALES                             2014

There is a new option in customer edit to allow the user to view all lots entered for a customer in ALL
sales currently open. This will help the user to check they have entered all lots from an entry form
even if they have been entered in to a number of different sales.

In the customer edit screen under the seller option at the top there is a new option.




This option is only visible if the sale is a FURN sale.

If this option is selected the program will go and search all open sales for lots for this customer and
display them on screen as below.




If there are no lots entered for the selected customer in any open sales then the user will get this
message.
