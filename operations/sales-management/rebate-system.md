Rebate System

Before using the rebate system  ensure  you  have  set  up  item  types  for
rebate. For example find an unused item type in this example A1 and call  it
Rebate, or Cattle Rebate, or Sheep Rebate (or set up  several  if  you  need
to). Make a note of the markets NAS account number. You  will  need  to  use
the Stock Analysis options to create a csv file with the  sellors  you  wish
to reward.
