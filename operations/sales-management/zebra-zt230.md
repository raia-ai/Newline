Zebra ZT230

Press Home button to enter menu

Press Left or Right to navigate to Settings then OK

Press Right once

Press Right twice

Press Right third time. Press Up or Down to ensure Media Type is Gap/Notch

Press Right fourth time. Press Up or Down to ensure Print Method is Thermal Trans. Then Press Home button to Save these settings

Ensure the Media Type is set to Thermal Transfer in the Printing Preferences

Note the Red Dot, this is the Media Sensor. This needs to be slid to the right so that it is towards the middle of the label. This sensor sees the gap between the labels and then prints correctly onto the label. If the sensor is too far to the left of the label it may not see the gap and therefore it won’t print correctly onto the label and this is when more than one lot number is printed on a label or labels are missed altogether.

There are some very clear and detailed videos available on the Zebra Website;
