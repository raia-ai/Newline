Auto Sale Numbers

For sales from 2009 onwards you should no longer need to add a week number
when setting up sales as this will be done automatically for you. You still
have the option to override this if an issue occurs. Please call us if you
require more information then is list below.

When you go to setup a sale it checks to see if it can see your main
server. If it can’t it warns you and allows you to setup a sale the old way
without using auto sale numbers (enter sale number). Please check with the
auction manager before entering a sale number.









If all ok then it takes you to the ‘enter date box’. All the other options
are disabled until you enter the date. When you enter the date it checks
the database for the relevant auto sale number. To make sure you have
entered the date correctly it will show you the whole date.



Using the auto sale number you no longer see the sale number box.

Once the sale is setup you get all the details of the sale

Clearing old files

NAS will now clear a lot of old files when setting up the sale.

Mapping to your servers

         • We can now set your workstations to map to your servers
           automatically when running NAS. This can be switched on and off
           by a market administrator.
