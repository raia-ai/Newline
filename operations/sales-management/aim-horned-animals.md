Intro
Ireland are allowing horned cattle to be sold at market (but not through the sale ring). AIM want an
identifier in the lot number field.

Suggestion in NAS




Book in all horned cattle with a unique lot number at prefix of lot number and the word HORN after
the lot no.

AIM
Having spoken with AIM they are expecting the word HORN to be included in the lot number field
after the number part of the lot number (not before).
