1.  Potential Conflict with Screen Savers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------
Some screen savers will interfere with the operation of Iomega  Backup.   In
addition, the screen savers may not activate while  a  backup,  compare,  or
restore is running and Iomega Backup is minimized. For optimum  performance,
we recommend that you disable your screen saver while using  Iomega  Backup.
However, if you wish to use your screen saver,  you  must  first  make  sure
Iomega Backup is not minimized.
