                           Commission / Phone Bid System

There is a new option in the Buyer Reports Menu to allow the user to enter commission / phone bids
in to the sale.




This comes up with the following option.




This is to allow the user to select the customer that has left the commission or phone bids.

This is the normal customer search option so the user can enter a customer number, buyer number
or buyer surname and initials and address to find the required customer.

Once the customer has been selected the system will display the following.
This shows the customer selected top left, the commission bids already entered for the selected
customer are shown in the grid top right. This shows the lot number, bid value and the date and
time the bid was entered.

The user then entered the lot number that the customers wants to leave a commission bid for. The
system will then display the following for this lot.




This shows the lot description and any reserve entered for that lot and then in the grid on the right
any other commission bids entered for that lot, who the customer is and when the bid was entered.
It also shows any phone bids entered against that lot.

If you try and enter a commission bid for a lot that that customer has already left a bid on then the
system will warn the user that this is the case but allow them to save it if required.
Once the commission bid has been entered for a lot the user can just enter the next lot number and
commission bid for that customer.

If the user is entering a phone bid then instead of entering a value in the commission bid field leave
this blank and enter the phone number that the customer wants you to call them on in the phone
number field and this will record this information so they can be contacted during the sale.



Lot Edit / View All Lots.
There is a new View Comm Bids button on the below screen and if there are any commission bids
entered for the selected lot then this will show on the button in (). So on the below lot there are 5
commission bids entered.




If the user clicks on this button then they get this below screen.




This does not allow the user to enter anymore commission bids for that lot but it does show all the
different commission bids entered and who they are for.
There is an option in sale totals if you right click on the section you are interested in to view
commission bids entered in to the sale.




This will display the below screen.




This shows all the different lots with the commission bids entered and the bids will show in value order
and then date and time entered. There is an option under the file menu option to change the font size
of the report so it is reasier to read. There is also a print report option which if selected will display
the following screen after the printer has been selected.
This gives the user the option to remove an columns they don’t require on the printed report so it
will only print the details they are interested in.


Auctioneers Terminal
The below screen can be used by the auctioneer to view all the details relating to the lot currently
being sold. The user will first select the section for the lots being sold and then enter the starting lot
number. The screen will then show the lot number being sold, any reserve entered for that lot, any
price range entered and the lot description. It will also show the top 3 commission bids entered for
that lot in descending order by value and if there are two bids for the same value then by date and
time entered. It will show the buyer number and buyer name. There is also a space on the left of the
screen to show if there are any phone bids entered so the auctioneer can easily see if they need to be
looking towards the location of the phones for the phone bids. There is also an area on the screen for
the auctioneer to view any messages relating to that lot or to the sale in general.
