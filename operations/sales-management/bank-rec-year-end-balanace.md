Intro:

What options should I use to check the year end balance?

1. Listing of outstanding cheques at 31 December 2014

Go into the Bank Reconciliation menu and select the options menu and View Bank Lists

In this screen unmatched is selected by default (these are the outstanding cheques)

Alter date range. The to date defaults to todays date. Click the continue button

Currently it looks like this on your system as at today. You can double click the row with the clients account to view the individual cheques involved.

2. Listing of total cheques cashed during the period 14 May - 31 December

Select matched. These are cheques that have been presented to the bank and the statements matched off.

3. Listing that combines 1&2 above.

4. Listing of all lodgements during the period.

5. Listing of all adjustments made to bank reconciliation.
