Additional Detail :

  Connell,

  This quote is for the following;
  xTo install a Live Streaming Camera on the weighbridge for a pre view of the lots for online bidding.
  xTo install a second TV screen on the wall opposite the auctioneer to show the online bids as they come in.
  xTo install a second TV screen in the sellers box to show the lot details.
  xTo install advertising media player in main office

  All kit to be bench tested at Newline HQ, kit to be installed, commissionned and tested onsite and staff trained.
  To save you on installation costs, it would be best to arrange this install for the same time as DEM move the weigh unit from the
  rostrum to the back of the weighbridge.

  Please note, the mart is to supply and mount the three TV's, electrical power points are required for camera, media player and TV
  displays. (The weighbridge will also need an electrical power point)
