Notice 718/2: VAT Auctioneers’ Scheme
March 2011


Foreword
This is a new notice that has been introduced for the VAT Auctioneers’
Scheme. The contents of this notice were previously included in Notice
718

1. Introduction
1.1 What is this notice about?
This notice is about the Auctioneers’ Scheme, which is a variation on the VAT
Margin Scheme for second-hand goods, antiques, works of art and collectors’
items. It tells you when you may use the Auctioneers’ Scheme to account for
VAT on the supplies you make.

It explains

   •   which goods you can include under the scheme

   •   how the scheme works

   •   how you must calculate the margin, and

   •   what records you must keep.

This notice assumes that you have a working knowledge of basic VAT
principles, as outlined in Notice 700 The VAT Guide.

If, after reading this notice, you need any further help or advice, contact our
VAT Helpline on 0845 010 90000300 200 3700.

1.2 What’s changed?
The information in this notice used to be contained in Notice 718 Margin
schemes for second-hand goods, works of art, antiques and collectors’ items.
We have moved the information which is relevant to auctioneers who opt to
use the Auctioneers’ Scheme into this separate, shorter notice so that you can
find what you need more easily.

The rules about declarations on Auctioneers’ Scheme invoices have changed:
see section 4 for details.

We have updated the Notice to reflect the VAT rate of 20%.

1.3 Who should read this notice?
You should read this notice if you are an auctioneer and you want to know
about the Auctioneers’ Scheme.

Notice 718/2: VAT Auctioneers’ Scheme
March 2011


1.4 Force of law
In UK law, Section 50A of the VAT Act 1994 allows the Treasury to make
Orders to introduce second-hand schemes.

The VAT (Cars) Order 1992 covers cars.

The VAT (Special Provisions) Order 1995 (as amended) covers all goods
other than cars.

Parts of this notice have the force of law under the orders. Paragraphs which
have the force of law are indicated by a statement and by having been placed
in a box.

2. Basic Principles
2.1 I am an auctioneer: how do I account
for VAT?
If you

         •    invoice in your own name, and

         •    sell goods which would be eligible for sale under the
              Margin Scheme

there are several options you can choose from to account for VAT on your
sales.

You may

         •    use the Auctioneers’ Scheme

         •    use the Margin Scheme

         •    apply the rules for invoicing as an agent.

You do not have to apply the same option to all your sales. This notice is
about the Auctioneers’ Scheme. Please see Notice 718 The VAT Margin
Scheme and Global Accounting for more about using the standard margin
scheme, and for more general information about margin schemes.

2.2 What is the Auctioneers’ Scheme?
The Auctioneers’ Scheme is a variation on the standard margin scheme for
second-hand goods, works of art, antiques and collectors’ items. It allows you
to account for VAT on a margin which is equal to the value of the services you
have supplied to the seller and the buyer.


                                        2 of 27
Notice 718/2: VAT Auctioneers’ Scheme
March 2011

Using a margin scheme means that you don’t have to account for VAT on the
hammer price of the goods.

2.3 How does the scheme work?
When you calculate the margin under the scheme, you:

       •      add the value of your services to the buyer to the hammer
              price, and

       •      subtract the value of your services to the seller from the
              hammer price.

Section 3 provides full guidance on how to calculate the VAT due under the
scheme.

2.4 What are the conditions for using the
scheme?
You don’t have to use any of the margin schemes: they’re optional.

If you do decide to use one, there are a number of conditions you will have to
meet. If you can’t meet all the conditions, you can’t use the scheme.

The detailed conditions for using the Auctioneers’ Scheme are explained
throughout this notice. The main ones are:

       •      the goods must be eligible (see paragraph 2.6)

       •      you must have acquired the goods in eligible
              circumstances. In most cases, this means that you
              obtained the goods for resale in circumstances where you
              could not claim any VAT back (see paragraph 2.5)

       •      you must calculate the margin in accordance with the
              rules of the scheme. There are special rules about how
              to calculate your buying price, your selling price and your
              margin under the scheme. The margin you calculate
              under the scheme may not be the same as your profit
              margin (see section 3)

       •      you must meet the record keeping rules of the
              scheme. There are special rules about invoicing and
              stock records (see section 4).

2.5 When can I use the scheme?
You can use the scheme if

Notice 718/2: VAT Auctioneers’ Scheme
March 2011

       •       the goods are eligible

and the seller is one of the following:

       •       not registered for VAT

       •       a VAT-registered person supplying goods under the
               standard margin scheme or Global Accounting

       •       an insurance company selling eligible margin scheme
               goods which it has acquired as the result of an insurance
               claim (provided the goods are sold at auction in the same
               state), or

       •       a finance house selling eligible margin scheme goods
               which it has repossessed (provided the goods are sold at
               auction in the same state).

2.6 Which goods are eligible to be sold
under the scheme?
This is a quick guide to the goods which are eligible to be sold under the
margin schemes. If you are in any doubt, you should refer to section 20 at the
end of Notice 718 The VAT Margin Scheme and Global Accounting, where we
have reproduced the law on eligible goods.

Second-hand goods

The legal definition of second-hand goods is goods which are suitable for
further use as they are, or after repair. In most cases, goods which are
second-hand in the ordinary usage of the term will be eligible for the margin
schemes.

For the special rules about the legal definition of a second-hand motor
vehicle, see Notice 718/1 The VAT Margin Scheme on second-hand cars and
other vehicles.

Works of art

The legal definition of works of art includes pictures, paintings, collages and
drawings executed by hand by the artist. Craft items and items produced in a
technical or industrial context may not be eligible to be sold under the margin
schemes. If you are in any doubt, check the list at the end of Notice 718.

Antiques and collectors’ items

The legal definition of an antique is an item, other than a work of art or a
collectors’ item, which is over 100 years old.

Notice 718/2: VAT Auctioneers’ Scheme
March 2011

Not everything which somebody might collect will be included in the legal
definition of a collectors’ item for margin scheme purposes. If you are in any
doubt, check the list at the end of Notice 718.

2.7 Are there any categories of goods I
can’t sell under the scheme?
Yes. You must not use the scheme to account for sales of

       •      precious metals

       •      investment gold, or

       •      precious stones.

There is more information about these categories of goods at the end of
Notice 718.

You can only use the scheme to account for sales of air guns if you are
registered under the Firearms Act 1968.

2.8 What if I make sales under the normal
VAT rules as well?
You can use a margin scheme for some of your sales and the normal rules for
others.

But, if you have sold an item under the normal VAT rules (that is, you charged
VAT on the full selling price), you can’t go back and apply any of the margin
schemes to that sale later.

2.9 What if I can’t meet all the conditions?
If you sell an eligible item, but cannot meet all the record keeping, invoicing
and accounting requirements, you cannot use either the Auctioneers’ Scheme
or the standard margin scheme.

You will have to pay VAT on the hammer price as well as on your services to
the vendor and the purchaser under the normal VAT rules for undisclosed
agents. You can find further information about those rules in Notice 700 The
VAT Guide.

It is important to check with the seller whether the goods are eligible for
inclusion in the Auctioneers’ Scheme before you auction them.

3. Making your Auctioneers' Scheme
calculations
3.1 How do I calculate VAT on goods I sell
under the Auctioneers’ Scheme?
As explained in paragraph 2.2, you calculate your margin by taking into
account charges for the services you make to the seller and the buyer.

When you are calculating the amount of VAT due on an individual sale, you
must work from the hammer price, as follows:

Scenario                                Solution

Your purchase price is                  the hammer price less any commission
                                        charges you make to the seller.

                                        You must not include any other services
                                        which you supply to the seller.

Your selling price is                   the hammer price plus any charges for
                                        services you make to the buyer.

                                        (For example, buyer’s premium or other
                                        commission, or incidental expenses such
                                        as packing, transport and insurance costs.)

To calculate your margin                you subtract the purchase price from the
                                        selling price.

To calculate the VAT on the sale you multiply the margin by 1/6 (the VAT
                                 fraction).

Paragraph 3.2 explains which charges can be included in your scheme
calculations.

There are detailed examples of calculations at section 8.

3.2 Which charges must I include in my
Auctioneers’ Scheme calculations?
When you calculate your buying and selling prices under the Auctioneers’
Scheme, you must always include

       •      seller’s commission

       •      buyer’s premium, and



                                         6 of 27
Notice 718/2: VAT Auctioneers’ Scheme
March 2011

       •      any other charges you make to the buyer for incidental
              expenses such as packing, transport and insurance costs.

You must not include

       •      services which are a separate supply in their own right,
              for example, providing illustrations in the auction
              catalogue, or

       •      indemnity fees, if an approved insurance company is
              providing the insurance policy.

For more information about insurance provided by a third party, see Notice
718.

You must make sure that:

       •      the charges included in your scheme calculations do not
              show VAT separately, and

       •      your invoices clearly show (for the benefit of both seller
              and buyer) the respective selling and purchase prices
              they will need for their own scheme calculations.

If you have made any charges which are not included in your scheme
calculations, you must

       •      invoice for them separately, and

       •      charge VAT on them under the normal rules.

3.3 How do I work out the time of supply?
If you are acting in your own name, the goods you sell are deemed, for VAT
purposes, to be both a supply to you and a supply from you.

Because these two supplies happen at the same time, they share a common
tax point. This is determined by reference to the actual sale of the goods at
auction. The tax point for both supplies will be the earlier of:

       •      you handing the goods over to the buyer, or

       •      you receiving payment.

3.4 What if I sell zero-rated goods?
Under the Auctioneers’ Scheme, a margin is created from the supply of
services made to the seller and the buyer. These services are not separately
charged with VAT.



                                        7 of 27
Notice 718/2: VAT Auctioneers’ Scheme
March 2011

If you sell zero-rated goods, for example antique books, your margin will also
be zero-rated.

In the VAT due column of your stock record, you should insert ‘nil’.

3.5 How do I treat sales to other EC
Member States?
Sales made under the Auctioneers’ Scheme to other Member States are
treated in the same way as sales within the UK. The sales are liable to VAT in
the UK.

The goods will not be subject to acquisition VAT when they are taken into
another EC Member State, so you should not include them on

         •    EC sales lists, or

         •    boxes 8 and 9 of your VAT returns

See Notice 718 for more detailed information for businesses which use
margin schemes about buying and selling within the EC.

3.6 How do I treat goods supplied for
export?
If you                                      then

•  are acting in your own name              you will be making a combined supply
•  can meet the conditions for zero-        of goods and services, with VAT due
  rating in Notice 703 Exports and          on the profit margin.
  removals of goods from the UK,
  and                                       The liability of your services will follow
• sell the exported goods under the         that of the goods, with the result that
  Auctioneers’ Scheme                       the whole supply will be zero-rated.

                                            However, you must obtain proof of
                                            export, as described in Notice 703,
                                            when you apply zero-rating to the
                                            margin.

Notice 718/2: VAT Auctioneers’ Scheme
March 2011

sell the exported goods under the           the liability of your services will not
Margin Scheme                               follow that of the goods because your
                                            services are charged and invoiced
                                            outside the scheme.

                                            You will be able to sell the goods at
                                            the zero-rate outside the scheme if
                                            you can meet the conditions in Notice
                                            703, but your services will normally
                                            be standard-rated.


3.7 What about the Retail Export Scheme?
The retail export scheme allows certain overseas visitors to get a VAT refund
on goods they buy and export in their personal luggage. You can use the
retail export scheme together with the Auctioneers’ Scheme but, if you do, you
must account for VAT on the sale until

   •   you receive a refund document stamped by UK or EC Customs,
       and

   •   you have made the refund to your customer.

You can find more information about the retail export scheme in Notice 704
VAT retail exports.

4. The Auctioneers’ Scheme – records and
accounts
4.1 What records must I keep?
Notice 700/21 Keeping VAT Records gives guidance on the general records
you must keep if you are registered for VAT.

If you use the Auctioneers’ Scheme, there are some additional record keeping
rules which apply to your stock record and invoices – paragraphs 4.2 to 4.8
give details.

These additional rules exist so that there will be a clear audit trail of the
margin you have achieved on each item you have sold. It’s important that you
keep to these rules so that you can continue using the Auctioneers’ Scheme.
If we can’t check the margins you have declared from your records, VAT will
be due on the full selling price of the goods you’ve supplied, even if they were
otherwise eligible for the scheme.

If you are not sure whether your records meet the Auctioneers’ Scheme rules,
please contact our Helpline.

4.2 What sort of stock record must I keep?
The boxed text below has the force of law.

The following requirements has the force of law

Although you must always keep stock records, you don’t have to maintain a
stock book which is strictly in accordance with the requirements set out in
Notice 718.

However, if you don’t maintain a stock book, you must retain sufficient
alternative records which provide the information required in Notice 718.

Examples may include:

•    entry forms
•    sales catalogues
•    copies of lots and sales of the day, and copies of sales and purchase
    invoices.

4.3 What are the rules about invoices for
the Auctioneers’ Scheme?
The following requirements has the force of law

When you sell an item under the scheme, you must issue an invoice to both
the buyer and the seller.

You must

•  issue the seller with an invoice or statement which includes all the details
  in the table below, and
• issue the buyer with an invoice or other document which includes all the
  details in the table below.

    Margin Scheme.                            the Margin Scheme.
If either the seller or the buyer is using a margin scheme, their respective
selling and purchase prices must be clear from the invoices you issue. This
means that you should allocate any charges included under the scheme
against each separate lot.

In other words, if you are selling several items on behalf of one seller, you
must not put the total commission charged to that seller on the invoice for one
of the items.

Note: If the purchase invoice shows a separate VAT amount, the item is not
eligible to be sold under the scheme.


4.4 May I include scheme and non-scheme
supplies on one invoice?
To avoid causing the buyer confusion, we recommend that you issue separate
invoices if you sell goods to the same buyer under both the Auctioneers’
Scheme and normal accounting. However, you may, if you wish, include all
those goods on the same invoice.

If you choose to do this, you must ensure that each supply can be clearly
distinguished. The buyer must be able to establish the sales price for those
items which were sold under the Auctioneers’ Scheme. This amount will form
the purchase price for a VAT-registered dealer who will be selling the item on
using a margin scheme.

  and                                        records and cross-refer to the
• you are willing to re-invoice              amended transaction.

The replacement invoice which you issue to the buyer must

       •      refer clearly to the original transaction, and

       •      state that it is cancelled and that the buyer should amend
              their VAT account accordingly.

There is a limit to how long after the due date of the VAT return on which you
accounted for the original supply you may issue a replacement invoice. This is
because the capping rules prevent input tax being claimed on invoices over a
particular age. For up-to-date information about the capping time limits, see
Notice 700/45 How to correct VAT errors and make adjustments or claims.

4.6 How do I treat Auctioneers’ Scheme
invoices in foreign currencies?
If                                           then

you issue an invoice in a foreign            you must show the sterling equivalent
currency – including the euro – under        for each element of the supply – for
the Auctioneers’ Scheme                      example, the hammer price of the
                                             goods, the amount of commission,
                                             other charges due – and not just for
                                             the total value of the sale.

To convert amounts into foreign currencies you must use one of the methods
outlined in Notice 700 The VAT Guide. Whichever method you adopt, you
must use the exchange rate which is current at the time you make the supply.

4.7 Filling in your VAT return
At the end of each tax period you will need to fill in a VAT return. Here are the
special rules you must follow for any goods which you have bought or sold
under a margin scheme during the tax period:

       •      Box 1 Include the output tax due on all eligible goods sold
              in the period covered by the return.

       •      Box 6 Include the full selling price of all eligible goods
              sold in the period, less any VAT due on the margin.

       •      Box 7 Include the full purchase price of eligible goods
              bought in the period.

There is no requirement to include margin scheme purchases or sales in
boxes 8 and 9 of your VAT return.

Further guidance on how to fill in VAT returns is available in Notice 700/12
Filling in your VAT return.

4.8 How long must I keep records?
Generally, you must keep all your business records for VAT purposes for at
least six years. If the six year rule causes you serious storage problems or
undue expense, then you should consult our VAT Helpline. We may be able
to allow you to keep some records for a shorter period.

5. The Auctioneers’ Scheme in particular
circumstances
5.1 Can I use the scheme to sell goods on
behalf of a pawnbroker?
If                                           then

•  the goods are eligible                    you may use the Auctioneers’
•  the value of the pawn is greater          Scheme to sell the goods on behalf of
  than £75                                   the pawnbroker.

March 2011


5.2 What if I sell a horse or pony and use
the three-part form?
The three-part form is a document which can be used to account for VAT on
the sale of horses and ponies under the standard margin scheme. The three-
part forms come in numbered sets, with a VAT summary sheet at the back.
They are sold by the British Equestrian Trade Association (BETA).

When you sell a horse or pony on behalf of a person who is selling it under
the standard margin scheme and is using the three-part form, they will give
you Parts B (pink) and C (yellow) of the partially-completed form.

After the sale you should:

       •      complete the reverse of Parts B and C

       •      give Part C to the buyer

       •      return Part B to the seller.

When you sell a horse or pony on behalf of a person who is not registered for
VAT to a person who is registered, you should complete your name, address
and Lot number on the reverse of Part A (white) of the buyer’s form.

For more information about the special three-part form for the sale of horses
and ponies under the standard margin scheme, see Notice 718.

5.3 Can I use the Auctioneers’ Scheme for
the sale of new goods on behalf of non-
taxable persons?
An Extra Statutory Class Concession (ESCC), introduced with effect from 1
January 1999, allows the Auctioneers’ Scheme to be used for the sale of all
goods grown, made or produced (including bloodstock or livestock reared
from birth) by non-taxable persons.

As a condition of using the concession, you must obtain:

   •   a signed certificate from the vendor giving the vendor’s name
       and address

   •   a description of the goods, and

   •   confirmation that he/she is not registered for VAT nor required to
       be registered for VAT.

You may incorporate the certificate into your existing sales entry in agreement
with our Helpline. See section 6 for an example of the certificate.

7. The Auctioneers’ Scheme option for
goods on which VAT has been charged
7.1 When can I use this option?
When you obtain goods which have had VAT charged on their full value, they
are not normally eligible for the Auctioneers’ Scheme.

However,

if                                           then

•    you are an auctioneer, and              you may opt to use the Auctioneers’

                                           imported yourself (as principal on
                                           behalf of a third party) for onward
                                           sale in your own name, and

  described in paragraph 7.2
You can find details of import procedures and special arrangements for
supplies of temporarily admitted (TA) goods in Notice 702 Imports.

7.2 What are the conditions for using this
option?
If you want to take up the Auctioneers’ Scheme option in any of these
circumstances, you must meet the following conditions:

        •   you must inform our VAT Written Enquiries Team, 4th Floor
            West, Alexander House, 21 Victoria Street, Southend-on-
            Sea, Essex, SS99 1BD, in writing that you are going to take
            up the option, and you must specify the date from which you
            will be applying it

Notice 718/2: VAT Auctioneers’ Scheme
March 2011

       •   you must exercise the option for a period of at least two
           years, after which you must inform the VAT Written
           Enquiries Team (please see address above) in writing as
           and when you wish to stop using the scheme

       •   you must use the scheme in respect of all transactions and
           goods listed in paragraphs 7.1, not just in respect of certain
           categories of transactions or certain categories of goods, and

       •   if, having exercised the option, you decide to sell any goods
           covered by the option outside the scheme (for example, if
           you export the goods), you are not entitled to recover any
           input tax on those goods until the period in which you
           account for VAT on their sale.

7.3 What are the rules about goods held
under Temporary Admission (TA)?
Works of art, antiques, and collectors’ items imported into the UK from places
outside the EC Member States qualify for a reduced rate of import VAT
(currently 5%).

Such goods are often entered for relief under Temporary Admission
(previously known as Temporary Importation) in order to be sold at auction.
See Notice 200 Temporary importation.

Once the auction has taken place, the goods are

       •      re-exported from the EU

       •      declared to another Customs procedure, for example
              Customs Warehousing (see Notice 232) or Inward
              Processing Relief (see Notice 221), or

       •      finally imported.

If imported, the goods qualify for the reduced rate of VAT but the buyer’s
premium does not. You may use the Auctioneers’ Scheme to account for
sales of such items by auction, but you must charge VAT on the buyer’s
premium at the appropriate rate.

If the goods are                             then

•   finally imported, or                     you must charge VAT on the buyer’s
•   declared for entry to Customs            premium at the standard rate.

    Relief after the auction
directly re-exported from TA                 you may charge VAT on the buyer’s
following the auction                        premium at the zero rate.

7.4 What is my purchase price when I use
this option?
7.4.1 Imported works of art, antiques and collectors’
items
When you opt to use the Auctioneers’ Scheme for imported works of art,
antiques or collectors’ items on behalf of an overseas seller, the option will
apply to imports at a reduced rate of 5%.

You must not

   •   reclaim the import VAT as input tax, or

   •   include it in your Auctioneers’ Scheme calculations.

(You may, however, wish to recoup the amount from the seller outside the
scheme.)

You must calculate your purchase price in accordance with the rules in
paragraph 3.1

7.4.2 Works of art obtained from the creator or their
heirs
When you opt to use the Auctioneers’ Scheme for works of art obtained from
the creator or his heirs you must not reclaim any VAT charged by the supplier.

If the work of art is an acquisition you should

   •   account for acquisition tax in box 2 of your VAT return, and

   •   not recover the corresponding acquisition tax in box 4 (Input
       Tax).

You must calculate your purchase price in accordance with the rules in
paragraph 3.1.

The creator, or their heir, will have to account for output tax on the full
hammer price, so they may ask you to sell the item under the option for the
standard margin scheme (see Notice 718), rather than the Auctioneers’
Scheme.

If you account for the sale under the standard margin scheme, you must show
VAT separately on any invoice/statement you issue for charges for your
services. This is so that the seller will be able to reclaim the input tax on those
charges.

8.1 What is this section for?
We have included this section to help you understand the effect that different
scenarios will have on the total VAT you would owe us for the same
transaction.

In all of the examples:

       •      the hammer price is £1,000

       •      the rate of VAT is 20% and the VAT fraction is 1/6

       •      the commission is a VAT-inclusive rate of 12%, that is,
              10% plus VAT, and

       •      buyer’s premium is a VAT-inclusive rate of 18%, that is,
              15% plus VAT.

If you sell the item under the Margin Scheme, you must charge commission to
the seller on a separate invoice, and account for VAT on the full amount.

Using the figures from this example, the commission to the seller is £100.
VAT at 20% on that amount gives a total charge for commission of £120.

Note: the total VAT you declare to us on the sale of this item under the Margin
Scheme will be the same as it would have been if you had used the
Auctioneers’ Scheme in Example 2. (£30 + £20 = £50.)
