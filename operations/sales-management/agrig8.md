AgriG8 in NAS

NAS users that join the agriG8 scheme are able to see aggregated debts from the scheme within their NAS software. This provides vital empirical up-to-date information to make better credit management decisions. This will hopefully reduce the risk of getting caught with large bad debts.

How to use it within NAS

Use the normal customer search option to find the customer you wish to review.

Click the Buyer Menu and the View Central Debt Information option

The user will see the buyers name and address details and the aggregated debt across the agriG8 scheme members.

The users will see how many group members comprise the aggregated debt total and see how the information was matched. It is very important to record as much information as possible against debtors on your system to help cross reference the buyers and aggregate them. Please get and keep holding number records, phone number records and email details accurate and up-to-date.

The example below shows they may be matched on holding number, telephone number, slaughter house number or email address. The example shows how different auction firms have slightly different company or surnames in their databases for the same customer, but the system aggregates the data together based on these other unique details.

This method may prove particularly interesting for tracking buyers running up big debts in different trading names or from different farms they own, as the name and address may vary but the other core data provides a link up.
