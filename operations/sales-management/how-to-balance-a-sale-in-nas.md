Intro-

The auction has finished, the buyers have been given invoices and the staff want to balance, process the lodgements (buyers and debtors payments) and close the sale. What reports help in this process?

Check sale balances before closing the sale

Note – if you have not done all you animal movement reporting this option may not be available. There is another menu option in NAS to load it.

Seller Details

The seller side shows the user the commission, charges, VAT, extra (top up) VAT refund, plus any cash to change transactions.

Buyer Details

The buyers side shows the buyers commission and charges plus all the payment methods and amounts. This report is divided between invoice payments on the day and further payments of old historical non sale day debts.

Lodgements

The sale day breakdown and old debt breakdown are then combined to show the figures the user will need to make a bank lodgements.

Summary

The summary shows how many cheques were produced and how many invoices were produced and the gross totals.

Other useful Reports:

Are all the buyer invoices done?

Go to the options menu and tick display only uninvoiced buyers. A caption appears above the sections to show the user this option is selected. Press the enter key. If this message box appears all the invoices are produced.

If it doesn’t and you see a list of buyers still to invoice you know which ones you still have to produce.

How do I check the buyers payments are correct?

Click the continue button.

The paid by column tells you if and how the buyer paid.

If they did not pay it shows unpaid and shows the outstanding amount (O/S) that will be posted to the sales ledger as a buyer debt.

It shows if the invoice was paid by cheque, cash, etc and if any discount was given.

The auction clerks will want to manually add up their float to see how much cash and how many cheques they have taken at the sale, and how many credit or debit card payments they have taken if they use these payment methods.

There are various options in the menus that are extremely useful to be aware of.

If you operate contra payments you will probably want to see details of these in the report. Make sure you have show payments by contra ticked. If you want to see today’s debts in the report make sure you have only buyers ticked.

Filter by payment type enables the user to check the balance of different payment types against the actual physical cash, cheques, etc taken virus what users have input in the invoice process in NAS.

If I want to view all cash payments I tick next to the cash box and apply. This will give me a list of cash payments and a total. If this agrees with the user’s manual total this part of the auction balances. If it does not the user needs to check the other payment types to make sure they have not marked an invoice as unpaid instead of paid, paid by cash instead of paid by cheque, etc.

How do I check I have all buyers cheques in the system?

User may wish to log details of all buyer cheques into the system. This helps track any issues with third party cheques and provides a reconciliation to ensure you have all the cheques ready to lodge and none have been mislaid.

Add details of the physical cheques you’ve taken and compare them to the payments made in the invoice program in NAS. If you’ve not taken any old debt payments the totals should agree and provide a printout of all third party cheques.

Cheques / Cash to Change?

Some auctions will change cheques for cash for their customers. A record of this sort of transaction can be logged in this option.

This produces a record of payment transaction changes which will help you balance you different payment types.

How do I check the sellers charges like transport have been added on?

The list of possible cheques can be run before an automatic cheque run is set off. It lets the user check that commissions and charges look correct and double check if all charges have been applied.

What about contras?

Run the report to see which sellers may be contra’d. You can either auto contra, contra in the sellers statement option or contra in the buyers invoice option. The choice is yours.
