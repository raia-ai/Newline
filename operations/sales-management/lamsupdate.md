Cows & Calves

Cows & calves can now be sold in the option, Enter Lots During the Sale,  to

details should be entered first followed by the calf, or calves  details  as
is shown below.

Fast & easy lot amending

Amending lot details is made far easier  in  this  program  release  through
several methods. A plus sign ‘+’ may be used to step back  a  level  at  any
point. E.G. if the user has mistyped  the  lot  number  and  the  cursor  is
flashing down at the Enter type line, entering a ‘+’ and pressing the  Enter
key will place the cursor back at the lot number line. Another fast  editing
technique is included in this release by the line numbers on the  left  hand
side of the screen. When prompted Line to Amend 1-9,  the  user  enters  the
number of the line they want to amend and presses the Enter  key.  They  can
then make the amendment to the chosen field.

F8 Escape

The F8 key can be used to escape from more menus than ever before.  F8  will
take users out of the Enter Lots During the Sale option, out of  the  During
the Sale menu, out of Sale Sheet call through and  out  of  the  Pre-booking
options.

Repeat Remarks

For certain types of sale it can be useful to  keep  the  remarks  from  the
last lot. For instance in furniture or  implement  sales  the  user  may  be
selling picture frames and want the remarks kept from the last  lot  entered
so it is not necessary to keep typing picture frames over  and  over  again.
This option is set in the Installation Menu, in option 5 Amend  Animal  Type
Settings. Select the letter of the type that  requires  changing  and  press
return. Press return  through  the  commission  screen,  maximum  &  minimum
screen, booking choices screen, until you get to the fourth screen with  the
breed and remarks choices. If repeat remarks is required the user  must  set
the choice to R. There  is  a  white  line  under  the  remarks  field  that
indicates how many characters may be typed in.

More information from the passports

This latest Newline ASP release can take the breed from the  passport.  This
option involves setting up the client breed file  to  cross  reference  with
MAFF’s breed list and takes a little time. So please  be  patient  when  you
request this from Newline ASP.

Enter Lots During the Sale

This option allows users to load and sell lots in one  transaction  and  has
been updated to provide a number of benefits requested by  many  clients  in
recent months.

The user is prompted with a  series  of  questions  when  they  select  this
option:

[pic]

These questions quite simply mean is the user in  the  sale  ring  operating
the computer and are the lots  sold  in  £s  or  Guineas?  Therefore  answer
according to your firms set up and requirements.

[pic]

Are the animals being sold as fat stock or store stock,  if  neither  select
store as less questions are asked.

Select the section required:
[pic]

The user is prompted to enter the vendor name and number.

The user is prompted for holding number and farm assurance  number  if  they
are not already in the customers account. This option has been added to  the
system to save users time. At this point you may enter these details if  you
have them, or press the Enter key to continue. The user  may  also  enter  a
different date if the animals have been in lairage before the sale date,  or
just press return to accept the current market date.

[pic]

The  main  differences  in  the  new  version  of  this  program   are   the
amended/editing facilities,  information  gathered  from  the  passport  and
facility to input cow & calves properly.

Furniture Lot Inputting

Using the Enter Lots During the Sale option in the  During  the  Sale  Menu,
users can input a run of identical  items with ease. E.g. if a user  had  to
input 10 lots of 10 chairs they could enter lot number 21-30 and  number  of
heads 100, this would create 10 lots of 10.

FABBL transactions

Before this release it was the  vendor  who  was  FABBL  registered  in  the
Newline ASP system, but this has now been improved. Not only can the  vendor
be FABBL registered, but also if one of  the  animals  that  the  vendor  is
selling is not then a record can be made of this  fact.  When  entering  lot
details the user is asked if the animal is farm assured  and  can  amend  it
accordingly. The user will only be prompted for the FABBL status of the  lot
if the vendor has a FABBL number on their file. If the vendor does not  then
he is not Farm
Assured so his stock cannot be farm assured so the user  does  not  get  the
prompt. This FABBL option needs to be  set  up  in  the  Installation  menu,
under the Amend Animal Type option. Select the  letter  to  be  amended  and
press the Enter key 4 times until presented with the screen shown below:

[pic]

Under the Anim Type Heading (not shown above, but is shown  on  real  thing)
the user should enter a B if they require  the  FABBL  prompt  against  Beef
lots.

Print Sale Sheets whilst pre-booking

The user can choose to print sale sheets when pre-booking the sale.  In  the
option, Pre-Book Lots the user is prompted as follows:

[pic]

If Y is selected for Print Sale Sheet, then as you  would  expect  the  Sale
sheets are printed as the lots are entered. The information provided on  the
print out is Vendor name and number, lot  number,  animal  type,  breed  and
weight if input.

The batch file question  is  relevant  to  customers  using  the  Sale  Ring
software. If you do not use the sale ring software the answer should  be  N,
for no. The batch file prompt should only be  Y  if  the  animals  are  sold
individually or if the user is entering the lots immediately before they  go
into the salering and the  animals  are  not  numbered  with  different  lot
numbers. If they are using the batching software then they MUST NOT say  yes
to this option.

The catalogue question produces a file in the folder specified by the  user.
This file can then be imported into word, and a catalogue produced.
