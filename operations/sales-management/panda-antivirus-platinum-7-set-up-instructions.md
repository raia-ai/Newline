Panda Antivirus Platinum 7 Set up Instructions

To open Panda Antivirus Platinum 7 Click Start > Programs (All Programs on
XP) > Panda Antivirus Platinum > Panda Antivirus Platinum, or double-click on
the Panda icon if on the desktop. This is not the same as the icon in the systray
by the time.




The main Panda window will open as shown below. Note:- Screens may slightly
depending on the version of Panda 7, i.e. 7.02.00 or 7.03.00, 7.04.00, etc. Check
with Newline on a regular monthly basis to see if there are newer versions
available.




To configure the scan options click the General Options choice.

Uncheck the CDROM Drives and Network Drives box.
Tick the Enable CPU load control box.
Select the options shown as above and click the Ok button when they are the
same. Some versions do not have the Remove the Restore folder from the scan
box, do not worry about this.

Click the Update tab and enter the username and password you get when you
register online. You have to register in order to get these, and you need these to
get updates. Newline will have done this for you if you purchased Panda from us.

Return to the Permanent Protection window by clicking on the Ok button.

EMAIL

If the machine that you are installing Panda on is used for emailing you will need
to click the configure button by mail protection. This is where you protect your
email, either Outlook or Outlook Express. If you do not use email this option can
remain unticked.

Select all the options shown.

FIREWALL

The firewall should not be enabled unless you are an experienced user. It will
not work for computers that have less than 128MG RAM. It is recommended to
use the firewall if you have enough RAM and use ISDN or ADSL to access email
and the Internet.

Click Configure button next to Firewall option.

a warning such as:

If it is a program you recognise and need to use select Allow this connection, if it
is not, either find out what it is by searching a search engine like
www.google.com or Deny the connection.

Enable anti-dialler should be ticked.

All the settings recommended in this document will increase the protection to
your computer, but Newline in no way guarantees complete protection. All anti
virus and firewall programs are fallible, but do improve the general level of
protection. Security and Usability are at opposite ends of the spectrum the
settings we have recommended are intended to meet a happy medium between
the two.

NB. Check the Report Weekly.

Click the Report button in the main Panda program page. The Report will show
Update attempts, failures and successes. Network attempt blocks, Virus
disinfections and so on.

NB. When installing other programs such as Microsoft Office, messages saying
please ensure all programs are closed during the install or similar wording
means you must close Panda to avoid errors. Do this by right clicking the Panda
in the system tray and clicking Close Permanent Protection.
