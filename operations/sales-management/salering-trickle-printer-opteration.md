                      New Salering Trickle Printer Opteration.

There is a new option in the salering program that will print out a hard copy of the lot details as they
are sold as well as updating the sale roll electronic file. To set this up you will need to go in to the
Settings Option on the initial Salering settings screen and select the following option.




This will display a list of dot matrix printers installed on the system as the trickle print option will
only work with a dot matrix printer. You can select the required font size which I think would be 12
for a wide dot matrix printer and 17 for a narrow dot matrix printer.

Once the printer has been selected you will then need to tick the Using Trickle Printer option so the
system knows you have a printer attached and want to print out each lot details after each lot has
been sold.

The trickle printer will print out the following information.

Time Lot Sold
