AHDB Pedigree Reporting:

Pedigree cattle that have a full pedigree certificate should be reported to the AHDB as such. This document explains the process in NAS to facilitate the reporting correctly.

Pre-booking-

When pre-entering lots for pedigree cattle use the grade field to record whether the lot has a full pedigree certificate. Enter PED in capitals in the grade field.

This process is made easier by setting the tab stops.

Click the tab stops button and tick grade this will then ensure the focus goes into the grade field each time a lot is added.

If the user forgets to add the PED grade at this point it may be added using lot edit. Make sure the grade field is ticked in options.

Alternatively there is a system setting that Newline can apply which will look at the item type name. If the item type name begins with PED i.e. PEDIGREE COW it will automatically set the grade to PED if the section is a breedingcattle section.

Note itemtype name does not being PED

Itemtype name does begin PED

Edit the PED field-

When you view lots in lot edit or 21 sale totals you will see the pedigree ones with PED in the grade field. You can edit and add or change at this point.

AHDB report:

When you make the report to send to the AHDB it will record the PED in the grade field and report it to the AHDB as full pedigree cert.

Column D shows if the lot is pedigree or not and column M says PED if the lot is pedigree providing PED has been entered in the grade field.
