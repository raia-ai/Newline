Goods being exported to non EU countries providing certain legal conditions are met may be charged at zero rated VAT. One of the rules for this is that proof of export within 3 months of sale must be provided to the auctioneer.

Proof of export may be recorded in NAS in the export lot report within a sale or in the history options if the sale is closed. The sale has to be set up to prompt for a movement export form when an invoice or passout is produced. See appendix for details of how to set this up.

The user may select a date range to view and select if they want to see European buyers (VAT registered or not VAT registered) or Non European buyers. Press continue to view.

A results list is shown. Double click the row to enter notes and record the type of proof.

Once a sale is closed this may also be worked on from the history menu.
