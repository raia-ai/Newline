Internal Use Only : AHDB – Historically called MLC report

NAS menu option:

Newline have had a number of calls from people over the past few weeks regarding reporting sheep to the AHDB people. They are not getting the sheep breeds coming through in the file and they now need these. We have altered the endofsal.exe to pick up the sheep breeds from the correct position in the file as it looks like over time the breed program has altered and the short description that we used to use is different. The new version picks up the description from the new place and will then add this to the file for sending to the AHDB.

The new version also shows the user the details of what it is going to send in summary format as below.

The user can then click on cancel and not automatically e-mail the file to the AHDB if they want to view / amend any of the information prior to sending or they can click on send and the program will prompt the user to enter the e-mail address to send to if not already entered or display the details if entered and prompt Send File Y / N.

The e-mail address to send the file is auctionmarkets@ahdbms.org.uk

This program will need to be set in DEP in there are any problems sending the e-mail.

Please see below the definition of the age categories AHDB require for breeding sheep, they are probably more simple than some of you are reporting:

Ewe lamb (ELB) – female lamb destined for breeding, not yet lambed from this year’s crop

Ewe hogg (ELH) - female lamb destined for breeding, not yet lambed from last year’s crop

Shealing/gimmer ewe (SHR/GIM) – female which has completed one breeding season

Fully warranted ewe (FWE) – female which has completed two or more breeding season and is still fully productive

Broken mouthed ewe (BME) – female at the end of its productive life
