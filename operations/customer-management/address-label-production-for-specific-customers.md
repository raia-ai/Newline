           New Address Label Production For Specific Customers.

There is a new function to enable users to be able to create address labels for specific customers in
one go. The user needs to select the Seller / Buyer Trading Analysis in the history option.

The first thing to do is set up a mailing code and I would suggest this is set up and called Manual
Labels. Then set this mailing code against one customer in your customer database. I suggest this is
set up against an account for the auction company.




Then on the above screen select Customer and then the new Mailing Type in the types list.

This should then display the results with just the auction company details listed.




There is then a new button in the frame at the bottom of the grid Add to Grid.
If you want to add a particular customer to the address label run then click this button. You will then
be prompted to enter the account number of the customer you want to add.

This will then add this customer to the grid as long as their account is not closed and the number
entered is valid.




You can then add as many customers to the list as required.

You can then right click on the 1st row in the grid and choose to delete the record for youe account
so you don’t include this in the label run.

You then just need to click on Print Address Labels and answer the required prompts and the system
will produce address labels for the customers added to the list.
