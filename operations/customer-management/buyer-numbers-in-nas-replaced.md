Intro –

Buyer Numbers (aka paddle numbers) are used by auction firms in a variety of ways. They make it easy for buyers to bid and auctioneers to manage the buying process.

Permanent Buyer Numbers

Some auctioneers give regular buyers a unique permanent number. The buyer then uses this number each time they buy at different sales. It is uniquely reserved for them. The permanent number buyer list is found in this menu option.

Each time a new sale is set up the permanent buyer numbers are made available in that sale for use. The buyer numbers may then be used throughout the sale to call up buyers, sell to buyers and / or find invoices for buyers.

Some users want the system to auto allocate the next available buyer number. This may be done by pressing enter in the buyer number text box. Others prefer to type the buyer number in themselves and save. The choice is yours.

Temporary Buyer Numbers

Some auctioneers use temporary buyer numbers, each sale has a range of numbers that are used for the buyers at that sale that do not become permanently linked with the specific buyer account. This is often used when the buyers are not likley to be regular customers.
