Buyers Commission

To set buyers commission in NAS the user selects the following menus.

The user will only see itemtypes and buyer commission rates relevant to the sale they have selected to view.

Tech Note - This is from version 7.0.0.3 of markdeds (the buyer commission setup program) as at 8th Dec 2014. Previous versions showed all itemtypes even if they were not in use in the sale and the screen was overly cluttered and could be difficult for users to follow.

The user may decide to print the settings out to check they are as required. Click the print button and select the printer desired.

The user may double click a particular itemtype to edit and amend the commission rate.

If the user makes a change and clicks the ok button they are prompted

Be aware of what codes and what charges you wish to make. If you wish to apply the change to all A codes (or whatever letter you have selected) then click ok and it will change all 9 codes in that letter. If you only wish to change the one specific record click No.

Important make sure you click the F5 Save & Exit button to finalise and save the changes.

Make sure you test the buyers invoices to ensure the settings are as you require.

The settings are user changeable and as such Newline does not take responsibility for incorrect commission settings. The onus is on the user to ensure they are satisfied the commission rates are correctly set and checked by them (even if they have requested Newline make the change on their behalf to help them).
