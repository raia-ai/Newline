Find the customer you want and click the mailing info tab.

Select the group you wish to add the customer to and click the > button.

This moves the customer into the group.

Save the changes by pressing F5 or clicking save.

How do I produce a list for mailing purposes?

Tick customer.

Select the mailing type \ customer group.

Click the run analysis button

The list is processed and shows.

A list of names and addresses for the customers in that group appear. You have options to produce labels, emails or texts at the bottom of the screen. For more information on these see additional documentation.
