HOW DOES IT WORK?

Customer Search –

There is no requirement for the administrator to set the type of customer search index. They do not need to choose if the index is by initials or address. Now the user may search by either or both. In the example above JONES is the surname followed by the # symbol to show the next part of the search. SIMON is the first name followed by a # symbol to show next part of the search. Torquay is the town but could be any part of the address. E.g. JONES#S#1 MONTPELLIER TERRACE.

The user does not have to know or use the initials or first name. They may instead choose to search like this. JONES##TORQUAY.

Or they may continue to search by surname and initial only. JONES#S

Seller Statement \ Buyer Invoice Search –

There used to be an inconvenient flaw in the previous search system in NAS. If the customer account number did not begin with the same alpha letter as the customer surname it could be difficult to find the buyer or seller in the invoices option or seller’s cheques option by name search. The new system no longer struggles with this.

E.G. Customer account no = A155 and company name A J Burrows Ltd. If the surname field had Burrows Ltd in it and the Initials AJ the old system would not find this buyer if the user searched for buyers beginning with A’s.

The new search system deals with this efficiently and successfully.

Automatic Customer Synchronization –

Newline install and configure a service that runs automatically in the background updating any HQ customer database changes to remote \ satellite sites without the user needing to be involved.

New Customer Report –

Select the customer list option and tick New Customers Registered option button.

Enter the date range you are interested in and click ok.

Double click the new customer in the list if you want to see their customer account details.
