I have had a look at the vat question you have asked here and outline what the system is currently doing. I have also attached a copy of the same sellers details with the system set up in a different way which will give you the figures you are looking for I think.

The system is currently set up to deduct the commission from the gross ex vat before working out the extra .4% vat as this is how some of the marts operate. They were instructed by the vat people that the vat is worked out on your margin which is the hammer price less commission. Not all marts operate in this way so we have added a flag to the system to say if you want to deduct the commission from the hammer price before working out the extra vat. This is how your system is currently set. If we alter this in the file to not do this you end up with a statement that looks like the attached.

I will alter your system so that the commission is not deducted from the gross which will give you the totals you were looking for. If you want to do anything different than this then please let me know.
