VAT in Sage

Output and Input TAX

There are 2 elements to VAT:

Output VAT, or output tax, is the tax you charge on what's going out of the company ie what you're selling

Input VAT, or input tax, is the tax you pay on goods and services that you buy in to run your business eg raw materials or stock

VAT return

At the end of each VAT period - usually every three months - you must complete a VAT Return online. A return tells HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC):

how much VAT you charged to your customers, and how much you owe to HMRC on other supplies you've made

how much VAT you are entitled to claim back

the amount of VAT you must pay to HMRC or the amount of VAT you can get repaid by HMRC

the total amount of sales and purchases you have made

the total amount of goods sold to customers or purchased from suppliers in other European Union (EU) countries

How to complete Box 1 to Box 5

Box 1: VAT due on sales and other outputs

This is the total amount of VAT you charged on sales to customers. You must also include the VAT you need to pay to HMRC for certain other supplies that you've made, such as:

sales to staff, for example canteen meals or via vending machines

sales of business assets, such as commercial vehicles or machinery

hiring or loaning of goods to someone else

commission received from selling something on behalf of someone else

goods or services, such as products or computer software, that you or your staff take out of the business for personal use

gifts or samples you gave to someone that cost you more than £50

anything you bartered, exchanged or part-exchanged

any goods you bought that the reverse charge procedure applies to

fuel scale charges

Take away from this total any credit notes you've issued or debit notes you've received and enter the result in Box 1.

Box 2: VAT due from you (but not paid) on acquisitions from other EU countries

You need to work out the VAT due - but not yet paid by you - on goods that you buy from other EU countries, and any services directly related to those goods (such as delivery charges). Put the figure in Box 2. You may be able to reclaim this amount, and if so remember to include this figure in your total in Box 4.

Box 3: total VAT due

This figure is worked out automatically for you - and is the total of Box 1 and Box 2 added together. It is the amount of VAT that is due to HMRC.

You must not enter the total VAT due figure into Box 3 or any other box on your return.

Box 4: VAT reclaimable on your purchases

This is the VAT you have been charged on your purchases for use in your business. You should also include:

VAT you paid on imports from countries outside the EU

VAT you paid on goods you removed from a bonded warehouse or free zone

VAT due (but not paid) on goods from other EU countries and services directly related to those goods (such as delivery charges) - this is the figure you put in Box 2

Deduct from this total:

the VAT on any credit notes you've received

the VAT on any supplier invoices over six months old that you haven't paid and that you are obliged to account for as a 'bad debt'

The result is the total VAT you can claim back from HMRC.

Read more about relief from VAT on bad debts in VAT Notice 700/18

Box 5: VAT payable or reclaimable

This is calculated automatically from Box 3 and Box 4 - deducting the smaller figure from the larger one and entering the difference.

Before completing the remaining boxes of your return, please make sure that the figure shown in Box 5 on your return (ie the net VAT due or repayable) is the same as the figure you have calculated. If it isn't, then you have either entered a figure incorrectly in boxes 1, 2 or 4, or there is a fault in your calculations. Please check that you have entered the correct figures, and amend the return as necessary before you click on 'submit', as you can't amend your return after you have submitted it.

Box 8: the total value of goods you supplied to other EU countries

Put in the total value of goods you supplied to another EU country and services related to those goods (such as delivery charges). Please note that services related to those goods should only be included if they form part of the overall invoice total. If these, or any other services, have been invoiced separately they should not be included. You should do this for all goods that were physically removed from the UK to another EU country, even if there was no actual sale, or if the sale was invoiced to a person or organisation outside the EU.

Remember to also include this amount in your Box 6 total.

You may also have to complete an EC Sales List (ESL) for supplies to VAT-registered customers in other EU countries.

You should not include in Box 8 the value of goods supplied to customers (including private individuals) who are not registered for VAT where you have not exceeded the 'distance selling' threshold. Each EU country can set its own distance selling threshold which at present must be roughly the equivalent of either €35,000 or €100,000.

Enter the total value of goods you received from VAT registered suppliers in another EU country and services related to those goods (such as delivery charges). Please note that services related to those goods should only be included if they form part of the overall invoice total.

You should do this for all goods that were physically shipped to you from another EU country, even if there was no actual purchase, or if the goods were invoiced to a person or organisation outside the EU.

Remember to also include this amount in your Box 7 total.
