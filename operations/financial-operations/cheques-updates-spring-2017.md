Seller Cheques

Introduction

This document provides an overview of enhancements in NAS to the seller statement program during the last quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2017.

Grid Font Size

Each user logged into NAS (providing they log on with different user accounts) may set the default font size for the grids used to display the seller names and seller lot details. This feature makes the screen easier to read at some of the higher screen resolutions on new kit.

e.g. Font size 8

Font size 12

Email Auto-run Statements

It is possible to email seller statements from the auto run. Seller’s need to have an email address stored against their account. If the seller is in a country recording EID tags for sheep in the system it is possible to email the sheep EID tags at the same time providing you have ticked auto-print sheep EID tags.

The system will prompt.

Press the F5 bug to email the tags.

You can find a copy of the email and attachments in the email report in the content management menu.

Email EID tags

When you email a statement it will email the EID tags as a separate attachment automatically if you click yes to message box.

Note – not moving seller email over automatically (WIP).

Emailing – pdf advice

NAS currently sends seller and buyer paperwork output as a pdf attachment when emailing. Recently there have been reports that some auction clients have found it difficult to open the attachments. Certain pdf readers will not open the attachments and view them as viruses. Our advice currently is to use adobe reader and open the pdf with that. It is possible to add a sentence to this effect in the email signature which may reduce calls from your customers saying they can’t open their copy statement or copy invoice. @yahoo addresses seem to be particularly prone to this.

Other Deduction Cheques

Charges may be made against a sellers account and payment allocated to third parties. For example you may wish to charge the seller a haulage fee and produce payment directly for the haulier. Or you may wish for a vet to inspect the animal, set the cost off against the seller and pay the vet. Providing at least one lot exists for the seller, even if the lots have not been sold you can add a charge through deductions and select who it is paid to.

Note – you no longer have to specify a + or – in front of the charge value. When you press the enter key having typed 65 it will automatically put a – in front of the value for you in the sellers cheque program.

The system will prompt a message. Select Customer to pay deduction to. If you wish to pay a third party click yes and search for them.

Save the charges.

In my example it shows a negative cheque position.

This is because no lots have been sold yet. The system will credit a self-billing invoice in the instance no lots are sold and hold the debt in the ledger. There is an option in the options menu which enables this procedure. It is up to the auction to determine whether this feature is required and set the menu configuration accordingly to meet their business needs. To enable it tick Create Self-Billing Invoices.

To find the payment for the other parties select menu option 5 from the sellers menu. View Other Deduction Cheques.

A list of cheque is shown and the user may produce a run or double click each individual cheque and process it like normal auction cheques.

For this option to work the user must ensure print zero gross accounts is ticked in the options menu.

Hold Deductions

Split lots

The user may wish to split lots in the cheques program. This may be done by double clicking in the heads column and changing the number of heads. Lot 50 began as 3 heads and was changed to 2 creating a sub lot of 1.

Sheep Unsold Licence – ARAMs postal address change

The correct postal address for ARAMs on sheep licences in England will show in this version.
