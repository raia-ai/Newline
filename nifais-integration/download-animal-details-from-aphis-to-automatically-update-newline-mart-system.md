You will see from this screen some blue lines and some white lines. The
blue lines are transactions that have already been downloaded from Aphis
and updated to the current sale so they cannot be loaded on again. The
lines that are white are new records that can be imported in to the mart
system. They will be imported in to the current sale if there is a tick in
the Selected column 2. Once you are happy with the details on the screen
click on the Update Button or press F5 and the selected transactions will
be added to the current sale. If the system finds any new customers that
are not on your system it will automatically load these on for you and give
them a new computer number. The system uses the herd number to cross
reference the Aphis customer with the customer on your system so if there
are customers without herd numbers against them these account could get a
new account.
