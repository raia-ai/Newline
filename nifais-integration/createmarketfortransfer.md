CREATE MARKET FOR TRANSFER


THIS OPTION IN THE MARKET SYSTEM IS FOR AUCTION FIRMS THAT  HAVE  MORE  THAN
ONE MARKET SITE AND INVOLVES  A  CENTRAL  MARKET  WHERE  ALL  THE  DEBT  AND
TRANSACTION DATA IS STORED AND A REMOTE SITE, OR  NUMBER  OF  REMOTE  SITES.
EXAMPLES OF THIS WITHIN THE NEWLINE ASP CUSTOMER  BASE  ARE  F.R.MARSHALL  &
CO., BAGSHAWS & KVN STOCKDALE, TO NAME BUT A FEW.

THE WAY TO WORK IT:

FIRST AT THE CENTRAL SITE:

ON THE SERVER AT THE CENTRAL MARKET  SITE  IN  THE  MULTI  MENU  CHOOSE  THE
OPTION CREATE MARKET FOR TRANSFER: E.G. MON,TUES, STORE, OTM, ETC,  WHATEVER
THE NAME OF THE MARKET IS THAT YOU ENTER WHEN PROMPTED “RUN A MARKET”  (THIS
COPIES UPDATED VENDOR AND PURCHASER  TRANSACTION  RECORDS  FROM  THE  MASTER
MARKET DIRECTORY/FOLDER TO THE REMOTE MARKET DIRECTORY.
CREATE A MODEM FILE: THIS ZIPS/COMPRESSES THE INFO  AND  STORES  IT  IN  THE
DOWNLOAD DIRECTORY IN A FILE CALLED DOWNLOAD.ZIP.

IN ENGLISH IT IS LIKE HAVING TWO A4 FOLDERS WITH PAPER FILES  IN  THEM.  ONE
OF THESE FOLDERS IS THE MAIN FOLDER THAT MUST STAY IN THE CENTRAL OFFICE  AT
ALL TIMES SO THAT PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE CAN ALWAYS HAVE  ACCESS  TO  IT.  ALL
THE NEW WORK DONE IN THE OFFICE IS KEPT IN IT. IF  YOU  NEED  TO  WORK  AWAY
FROM THE OFFICE AT ANOTHER SITE YOU NEED TO  TAKE  AN  EXACT  COPY  OF  THIS
FOLDER WITH YOU SO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE CURRENT INFORMATION.

SO FAR EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE ON THE SERVER AT THE CENTRAL  SITE  AND  ALL
THE DATA IS READY TO BE SENT TO THE REMOTE SITE.

TO CONTINUE THE ANALAGY YOU HAVE MADE AN EXACT  PHOTOCOPY  OF  YOUR  CENTRAL
FOLDER AND PLACED IT IN THE REMOTE FOLDER READY TO BE TAKEN OUT WITH YOU  TO
THE REMOTE SITE. NEXT YOU NEED TO TAKE THE FOLDER WITH YOU. IF IT  WHERE  AN
A4 FOLDER YOU WOULD JUST CARRY IT WITH YOU, BUT THE MARKET  DIRECTORY/FOLDER
ON THE SERVER NEEDS TO BE SENT BY MODEM TO THE REMOTE  SITE  VIA  PCANYWHERE
OR EMULINK.

AT THE REMOTE SITE:

PICK THE OPTION RECEIVE CENTRAL MARKET DATA. CHOOSE THE MODEM OPTION.

ONCE YOU HAVE THE MARKET ON THE REMOTE SITE SETUP THE SALE  AND  REMAKE  THE
INDEX THEN YOU CAN RUN IT  AND  DO  YOUR  DAYS  WORK.  DURING  THE  DAY  NEW
TRANSACTIONS WILL OCCUR AND NEW VENDORS OR PURCHASERS MAY  BE  ENTERED.  THE
CENTRAL MARKET COMPUTER WILL NOT HAVE THIS INFORMATION AS IT  HAS  ALL  BEEN
ENTERED AT THE REMOTE SITE, THEREFORE THE DATA HAS TO  BE  TRANSFERRED  BACK
TO THE CENTRAL SITE TO KEEP ALL THE DATA SYCHRONISED.

AT THE REMOTE SITE PICK CREATE DATA  FOR  RETURN  TO  CENTRAL  MARKET.  ONCE
AGAIN THE FILES THAT HAVE  CHANGED  DURING  THE  DAY  ARE  COMPRESSED/ZIPPED
(THIS IS DONE SO THEY SEND  QUICKER  ACROSS  THE  MODEM).  SEND  IT  TO  THE
CENTRAL MARKET VIA MODEM.

AT THE CENTRAL MARKET SITE:

CHOOSE RECEIVE RETURING DATA FROM MARKET. YOU MUST RUN  THE  END  OF  MARKET
ROUTINES BEFORE YOU CREATE THIS MARKET FOR TRANSFER AGAIN. THIS WILL  ENSURE
ALL THE DEBTS ARE COPIED AND THE ARCHIVING DONE.
