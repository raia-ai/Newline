Then choose option 2. Set Up New Sale.

The user is presented  with  a  list  of  sales  that  are  closed  and  are
therefore eligible to be set up again. Open sales will not  appear  in  this
list. The user may select the sale they require  either  by  double-clicking
the sale in the list, or by clicking it once and pressing the enter key,  or
by typing the number of the sale and pressing the enter key.

The user will then select the sale from the left  hand  list  and  the  sale
date must be highlighted in red to continue.

Enter the sale date in the format shown. Dd/mm/yy. Enter  the  week  number,
this is normally 2 digits followed by a predetermined alpha letter  that  is
used for turnover and debtor analysis to separate certain sales  and  sites.
E.g. 02W (this would show that it was the  2nd  week  of  the  year  (either
financial year, calendar year, or 2nd sale from when you started  using  the
Newline system). The W may be used to show it was a  Wednesday  sale,  or  a
sale at a certain site, or a certain stock type. Any letter may be used  but
it should always be the same letter that you  have  decided  to  use  for  a
certain type of sale. The sale description is what will be  printed  on  the
invoice and cheque stationary at the bought  at  label.  The  sale  type  is
either L for livestock or F for furniture and non livestock sales.

Most of the following questions are answered either by a Y for Yes or N  for
N, except for the Bank Account Letter. If you have  more  than  one  account
you will need to set up sales with  the  correct  Bank  Account  Letter  for
cheque reconciliation purposes. You may use any letter in the alphabet,  but
must decide at the  start  which  letter  relates  to  which  of  your  bank
accounts.

For livestock sales if you want to send MLC sale  reports  you  should  have
this field set to Y. This will prevent the sale from being closed until  you
have made this report.

If you have reps of field staff procuring stock and  you  want  them  booked
against the lots rep analysis should be turned to Y. This will  then  prompt
for a rep number when pre-booking stock.

If you are running a sale with buyer numbers this field should be set up  as
Y.

When you have everything set up as required pressed the F5 button or F5  key
on the keyboard.

When the sale is set up successfully you will see the following message  box
appear. Click ok and continue to run the sale.
