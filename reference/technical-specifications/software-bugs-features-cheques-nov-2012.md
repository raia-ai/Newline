Status Column Issue

Cheques version 7.1.297

Darlington report that the status column that shows paid comes and goes as you go in and out of cheques. We had similar issues with the invoices a while a go.

FIXED version 7.1.298 & Sent 051112

Why are cheques marked as cancelled?

Thirsk version 7.1.267

Cheque 271223 was given cash so the net amount came back to zero but for some reason a cancelled flag has been inserted into Outstand. This has happened with two records in Outstand within the same sale.

Same issue with a Huntly sale today. Version 7.1.272. They don’t have all cash option at Huntly but is cheque done at Stirling? Same version at Stirling same settings.

List of Cheques – Charges VAT column includes Cash issue

Chelford:

a copy of contra list and cheque summary over to you, a tad strange as cash has gone into the VAT column

Think this will need a software change. I’ve tested on my laptop with the same version of CHEQUES that Chelford have and with the latest from 10PROGS and the same issue occurs when running the option “List of Sellers to Contra”. Not a major issue as the amount to Contra is correct but the “Charges Vat” includes the CASH received.
