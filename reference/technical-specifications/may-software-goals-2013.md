Top Software Priorities in May

Stablise existing core apps (hopefully largley there now)

Fix the AIM 055 issue

Aphis work to deal with inferred moves on sheep being prevented in June

Xcira Internet Sales spec

Link up to One Digital Screens

Consolidation and Bug Fixes

March and April were largely used to consolidate NAS software and iron out bugs as they have been reported by customers. There are still regular reoccurring issues that I want to tackle in May. These include:

AIM 1138 / 055 error handle [Ritchie]

Cheques Locking

Counts2 Locking [Nick done some work to stabilise alinput with existing locking methods]

Sale Transfer UK [Ritchie]

vbWatch – log errors in database [Tobes]

Ongoing Development

There is also tidying up and polishing off ongoing software. Which includes:

Star Printing – alinput (use spooler like Salering) [SJ completed April]

Media Player Static Memo (Come to office) [Ritchie]

Salering (batching) [SJ test]

Bank Rec – auto match [Nige]

Item types – printouts / sliding [Ritchie]

.Net Seller & Buyer Reports [Rich]

Realistically not all of the items above are achievable in May, but are listed as jobs on the table to be done when time permits.

Requests

There are also requests / discussions for new software. Which includes:

Aphis Tests – 6 day mart standstill & inferred moves [Nige done in April]

One Digital Meeting

Network Weighbridges 24/7 [Nick done preliminary linkup test developmet]

UA’s credit report [Tobes done in April]

City’s iBidder Internet Charge request

Pugh’s lot label request [Nige underway in May]

Cork IBAN numbers

CSV generation - non standard characters Cheffins [Nige done in April]

NAS SQL Customer Updates

The fixes and enhancements being made in NAS need to be tested and distributed for Newline to get the full benefit of making the changes. I’d like to get a number of single sites (no remote laptop servers) targetted ad updated to SQL customers and the latest exes in the later part of May once I’m certain alinput and salering are stable and robust. These are:

Hopes

Leek

Malton

Mitchells

NELS

Norwich

Oswestry

Penrith

Sawley

Vicks

Wharfdale

Ballybay

Cashel

Colm McEvoy

Donegal

Maam Cross

Manorhamilton

Milford

Aled Ellis

Dai Lewis

Evans Bros

Rich I think you have already split this list up and allocated out to various support staff please. Once I’m satisfied the exes are robust I will give you the nod to hopefully get done by end of May / and into June. Then pushing into June we’ll tackle some of the bigger multi site customers (Kivells, McCartneys, Cale, JJM, etc)

May:

Consolidation of exes has taken a month longer than was originally envisaged but hopefully we are nearly there. Alinput appears to be more robust and is being used by some of our larger sites like Carlisle and Longtown without the earlier problems they had been reporting. Salering has been causing issues in new screen mode at Dungarvan and Dingle but both will have run the latest version by end of play today to give a better picture of were we are. Largely the plan is to consolidate what we have in NAS, and distribute the software and fixes. Whilst looking forward, planning and considering other jobs coming up in June, July.

Training:

SJ – hopes to set aside time to provide training on :

Bank Rec

Salering
