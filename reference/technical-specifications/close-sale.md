Close sale

When a sale is balanced and all the necessary publication reports have been taken out or emailed the sale may be closed. Closing the sale will post any unpaid invoices to the sales ledger (accounts receivable) as unpaid debts.

NB: The close sale control report will not let a user close a sale unless it is balanced.

Seller

The seller grid shows the goods total. Total hammer price for all lots. The seller commission is noted along with the tax on the commission (VAT in the UK). The first column under the seller header shows the charges descriptions. The total column shows the total charge for each description and the final column shows the tax on the charge. The cheques issued figure shows the total value to be paid out to the sellers after tax and charges have been deducted.

Buyer

The buyer grid shows the goods total. Total hammer price for all lots. The first column under the buyer header shows the charges descriptions and payment details. The total column shows the total charge or payment amount for each description and the final column shows the tax on the charge.

There is a payment breakdown showing how the invoices from today’s sale have been paid and a total of unpaid invoices (which will be posted to the sales ledger \ accounts receivable). There are also totals for what old debts may have been paid during the sale. The figures for today’s payments and historical debt payments are added together to give an overall payment as this may be the figure required for today’s banking.

The current sale information

The current sale information shows how may seller cheques \ payments have been made and how many buyer invoices produced. The seller gross, buyer gross and lot gross should balance. If they do not they appear in red and this normally shows there are still seller payments to process or buyer invoices to process.
