HOW DOES IT WORK?

Customer contacts you

Your customer phones you and has a query. You call up their record using customer search.

You may choose to click view contacts to see what you have recorded before about the query or you may wish to see if any of your colleagues have recorded something about it. This can be very useful if you have part-time staff job sharing.

You contact a customer

To Procure Stock

Set a follow up reminding you that the client said they would have 6 heifers ready in 6 weeks’ time for the spring sales. The follow up will remind you to remind them and ensure they come to your auction.

To Chase an unpaid debt

Set a follow up reminding you that they agreed to send you a cheque to pay their debt next week. If the time passes and they have not paid you will be reminded to chase them.

Follow Up Reminders

Setting a follow up reminder for a specific NAS user will ensure that user is reminded on the date they set when they log into NAS. The picture below shows the user set a follow up for 15th March.

When user NL logs into NAS the first screen they see is the contact follow up screen.

They may double click the row to see more info. They may click the mark as completed button if the task has been dealt with and it will not pop up next time they log into NAS.
