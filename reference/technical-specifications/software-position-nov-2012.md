General Info –

We have some apps that have 2 versions of the app and need to be combined to ensure we do not lose code and that we know exactly where we are. I think the apps in this state are:

Regbuyer

Endmar20

Alinput

Salering (possibly?)

I’d like to spend some time before the end of 2012 getting these apps pulled together and stored in the correct place in the code folder and tidy up all the old versions and versions in working that should no longer be there.

Regbuyer –

Cannot run on mylaptop due to a windows update that has knackered MS Windows Common Components – MSCOMCTL.OCX (Need to resolve)

Not completed the lot lists and list of invoices for Cheffins. Needs more work.

Altered invoice and cheque names search results to an itgrid but this is buggy and needs amending.

Regbuyer reported as hanging a lot and slowing down servers. Copy invoices and copy cheques hang need to alter away from modal form and add longer sleep time like invoices.

Nick altered something on server but different version to my laptop so need to merge together so not to lose development.

Need to look at copies of MC2, FCI and being able to email them.

Need to look at headers.ini and having different graphics for different elements of the auction business (like Cheffins Vintage and Sutton HQ or Gateway and GWA).

Would adding Ritchie’s print module give us more flexibility emailing printouts?

NWA Request - Katie would like to have an option to batch create all copy invoices & cheques and ideally save them as pdfs in a specified location. I understand that it is not possible at the moment and I advised her about it, but she still would like it to be put in the s/w. They are looking in to some kind of OCR software which would be able to itemise all invoices and cheques for customers etc

Endmar20 –

Two versions (at least) . 64 bit one with no QB apps involved to run close sale and old one which runs after QB endmars have run.

New version has issue with zip files going inside MASTER DIR folder and takes up a lot of back up space unecessariliy. RE has looked to alter code need to finalise and document version.

Need to double check that code SJ did to run new lot list option in regbuyer is in both versions of endmar mentioned above. Need to consolidate versions. Nick I could do with you showing me how the software comparison software works and spending some time with you before the end of 2012 getting all our software in order and documented.

Balance –

Aphis changes completed. A few lotstore issues have been reported which need to be checked out.

Chadwicks report - The general remarks is also not coming from the lot store to the sale

Ashford - Marie is unable to update the Lot Store with Unsold lots from a recent sale. As Gary stated clicking on update flashes something up on the screen and then it returns to the grid list. This was with version .273 so I then updated them with the very latest version 276 and the same thing as occurred. I’ve rolled back to .257 and the Store update has worked.

Simple –

Hanging

What is position with aged list of debtors?

Melton Request - Can we have the simple list of debtors done by surname, initials and address (not initials first). This is so they can sort by surname like in the other debtors list. Currently sorting on initials (I wonder if Iit it or is it sorting by Acc No?) which makes it tricky to match with other printouts.

Alinput –

Need to make AIM fixes (separate doc).

Need to add in Letter of Engagement (LOE) option for legal requirement in Ireland.

Invoices –

Bug if this sort of sheep lot number entered. Leek did this.

Sale Transfer -

Tipped as our most time consuming tech support call. Time set aside to add Ritchie’s sale transfer from NZ into UK software.

Buitelaar BOPs and Customeranalysis –

Dispute over a weekly charges report and weekly agent commission report. Do we write these FOC for them? Do we fix existing reports in customeranalysis which are hidden but may give them what they want or write fresh?

Ssheets –

Melton have asked if they can have the option of having additional space under the batched cattle, this is so when they split out the batches it’s easier to make notes.

Do we spend some time making the new itgrid option more flexible and user changeable for livestock as well as machinery?

.Net stuff :

Itemtypes –

Now in use in several new clients still needs more work regarding setting up charges. SJ had issues in Tipp with it. Also would like to add sliding set up option into it.

Importimages & imageviewer –

Not sure what state of play is with these apps. Need to discuss with RE, NH & PC. Are these apps fully developed and working at this time? Where is the versioning record kept?

Nasdisplaysystem –

What is the current state of play with this?

DataTransfer –

NasPrinting –

May look at using this in regbuyer?
