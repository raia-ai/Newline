Reports

There are a variety of sale day reports available in NAS.

Reports / Close Sale

The reports / close sale grouping shows users the options to select from the sale day menu if they are looking for the majority of sale day reports or are in a position to close the sale.

Sale totals / lot lists

Within a sale, users can view all lots entered into the sale. In this option users can find numbers entered and sold, plus a great deal more.

The user is presented with a simple grid showing the section and the number of items entered in that section. In this example 440 cattle have been booked into NAS and 130 have been sold so far during the sale. The total is the hammer price.

Double click on the row to breakdown the section information further to show the number of specific item types entered and sold.

Press the escape key to bring the focus back to the original section grid. There is a right click option on the grid to offer the user many more reports.

View all lots

This report may be configured by the user to show different columns depending on what they wish to see. The left-hand side of the grid shows the lot number, seller account number, first name and surname. It shows the manifest number and item type description of the item \ stock.

The middle part of the grid shows the quantity in the lot, weight, price per unit (pound in this example), price per head, total price, type (cow in this example), colour and pen no.

The right-hand side shows the animal brand, brand location and the buyer number details.

This report may be printed or exported to excel \ csv.

From here the user may double click on the seller name and address label to load the customer edit screen for that seller or double click on the buyer name and address label to load the customer edit screen for that buyer. They may click the view seller lots label to load the seller statement screen or click the view buyer lots label to view the buyer invoice.
