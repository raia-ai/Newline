Overview

This document is designed to give an overview of the NAS Online Sale Editor Option. The option allows users to create sales on the Newline Cloud API which will provide functionality such as catalogue searching and commission bids.

Usage

Loading a new sale onto the cloud for a sale already setup in NAS

On load of the option the user is shown the following screen allowing them to select the sale they wish to load onto the cloud,

The user can select the sale they wish to use in this case we will add the Chattels sale, we’ll click this and click continue,

The option will then check the cloud to see if there are any sales already setup for the company. If there are not then the user is presented with the following option allowing them to setup a new sale,

The setup has the following options,

Once the details are filled out the user can select save to create the sale online. The user is then taken to the section selection screen/lots screen.

This sale is then tied to the NAS sale so the next time the user runs the Online Sale Editor option the sale is marked with a green globe in the bottom left to signify the sale is tied against an online sale,

Loading a new sale onto the cloud before a sale is setup in NAS

Users can also add lots to the cloud before they are setup in NAS. To do this click on the cog option n the top right and select the ‘Add/Edit Online Sales’ option shown below

The following screen is then shown,

The user can then select the Add option to create a new sale with the same options they were presented if they were to setup a sale already setup in Nas (See previous example for notes on options)

Once the user saves the new sale it is shown on the list of sales below,

When the user is ready to link the online cloud sale between NAS and the cloud they can go into the Online Sale Editor option and select the sale. Once done the check for existing sales will be performed and all online sales will be listed. The user can then choose where to select a sale from the cloud or create a new online sale using the following option,

The drop down list shows lists all the sales on the cloud that are not tied with a  NAS sale

The user can then choose the cloud sale they would like to update. Alternatively, the user can click select New which will take them to the option detailed in 3-A.

Loading lots into a Cloud Sale

The user is presented with the lots onscreen.

The user can filter this in a variety of ways.

Lot number ranges can be used using the option in the top right hand corner

Additionally any column can be filtered using the filter drop down on the grid. The example below shows how to filter all items with Watch in the title,

Filtering the lots allows the user to select what lots they would like to put online and what lots they would like to tag

To select a lot to put online the item simply needs to be ticked in the first checkbox, this can be toggled on using the Select All / Select None option if the user chooses or they can be selected manually.

Tags make the online lots easier to search within the online catalogue. We could tag all of our filtered lots above with a tag of Watch. These lots can easily be filtered then on the clients website. To do this we’ll click the ‘Add Tags to Lots option’. The following option is the  presented

If the users website uses categories then the user can select a category for the tag else they can simply enter a tag, in this example we’ll just add the tag as the Silverwoods website doesn’t currently use categories. Clicking save will then add the tags.

If the user wants to view what tags are against a lot then they can click the + option on the lot row to show more details on the lot,

Once the user is happy to upload the lots they can simply click the Upload Selected option in the bottom right hand corner.

A preview of the updated tags and lots from the Silverwoods website is shown like so,
