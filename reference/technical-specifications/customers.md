Customers

Newline’s NAS has a customer database. A customer may be a seller, buyer or both. You only need to set up one customer account to enable that customer to be a seller and / or buyer. Finding customers or adding customers can be done in the customers group menu shown below.

Customer Search

The customer search option enables a user to search for a customer in the NAS database. The user may click on the label or icon, or type a 1 and press the enter key to launch the customer search screen.

By Surname

The user may search for a customer in NAS with as broad or specific search criteria as they like. In the example above the user has typed in JONES and pressed the enter key to search for all customers named JONES in the database. The results are displayed in a grid view and the user may select the one they require by double clicking on the row or by using the arrow up / down keys to highlight the row and press the enter key.

If the list of results was too long the user may choose to be more specific with their search criteria. For example the user may type JONES#S. This will search for all the JONES surnames in the database that have an initial of S.

By surname and initial

As the user types in the top entry box and uses the hash symbol (#) to denote a split in the searching fields the other entry boxes are populated to show the search criteria. See how JONES is populated in the surname field and S in the initials field although the user did not have to type these in there.

By Surname and address

A second hash symbol separates the criteria to be even more specific. It is now searching for a JONES that has an initial of S and lives in TORQUAY.

By customer account number

The user knows the customer account number and types it in and presses the enter key.

By buyer number

Some auctions use buyer number systems. They may choose to have permanent buyer numbers or may allocate temporary buyer numbers at each sale. The NAS system can handle either method.

Customer Edit

The customer edit screen shows the customers information recorded by the auction firm. The screen is split up into tabs to help the user navigate their way around the screen intuitively.

Name and address

The customer’s name and address details are shown in the above section of the screen. In addition to this the customer account number J2 is shown and there is a field to show a buyer number if they use this sort of system. The GST No is the tax number and will have a different description in different countries.

Phone numbers

The phones tab shows the customers phone numbers. The user may add as many as they require. The header label shows in brackets how many records are available on the tab. In this example the (3) in brackets indicates there are 3 phone numbers on this customer record. The user may decide to put a friendly description next to the phone number such as “accounts department”. They may also mark the number as P F or M (Phone, Fax or Mobile) if they wish.

To add or delete a phone number the user clicks the appropriate button.

Types the information into the new row and clicks on the save icon or presses the F5 function key to save.

Email addresses

The email address tab shows all the email addresses recorded against the customer account.

Invoice address

There may be a requirement for the invoice address to be different to the account address. That is the address that is printed out on the buyer’s invoice to be a different address from the account address. This is similar to the option on Amazon to have a delivery address and a billing or invoice address. If no address is entered here the default account address is used for the invoice. If this address is populated and a Y typed in the address on invoice field, then this address will be used.

Payment address

There may be a requirement to pay a different seller to the main account seller. This may be due to the estate being in probate or may be a father paying a son, etc.

Comments

The comments tab enables the user to add whatever comment they wish to about the customer. These comments are available to all staff at the booking in point in the system and at the point of producing seller statements and buyer invoices.

General

The general tab gives a quick overview of whether this customer has sold or bought. When the customer account was setup and whether and when it has been amended since. It shows which user registered \ setup the account and if the account status is active.

Active accounts will appear in customer name searches. Closed accounts do not appear in the name searches. This helps keep the name searches cleaner if old unused accounts are marked as closed.

The View amendments icon shows the user an audit of what has been added or changed in the customer edit screen.

Mailing Info

The NAS administrator has the functionality to setup as many mailing or customer groups as they require. These appear in the left hand grid under available groups. The user may set the customer up as belonging to one or several of these groups by moving the group from left to right into the registered groups grid.

These groups may be used for a variety of purposes. They may be used for marketing campaigns via print and post, text or email. They may be used to apply a particular type of charge to a group in the selling or buying process.

Bank details

Many auctions are choosing to pay their sellers through bank transfers. The NAS systems facilitates this (although there may be the need for this to be configured for the specific bank format). The customers bank account details are required and the Pay by BACs field marked as Y for yes.

Sales Ledger

As this tab may contain sensitive financial data it is possible to hide it or password it based upon user access levels and rights.

Main account number

Some buyers \ dealers may buy on several accounts to process different jobs and requirements they have. The Main A/C number field provides a method to ensure all outstanding debt for this buyer on any of their trading accounts is aggregated to one debtor account. The customer account number for the main account should be added to all the sub accounts.

Credit limit

The credit controller may wish to set credit limits on buyers. This will appear in a column on the aged list of debtors report and may also be used at the point of invoicing to generate a warning if the user attempts to produce an unpaid invoice (offering credit) and the value exceeds the credit limit.

Balance

Shows the debtor balance for the customer.

Accounts No

Some auction firms using third party accounting programs such as Sage may wish to record the accounts package account number in NAS. This can help with exporting data between systems.

Commission Override

For particularly good customers (only sellers in this option) the auction firm may decide to offer special commission terms. Different to the standard terms. Clicking the add icon provides the user with a range of chooses.

Other

Some auctions have reps or fields people that procure stock \items for sale on their behalf on a percentage commission basis. For goods sold that they have procured they will be rewarded with a proportion of the commission.

Premises ID

Customer edit menu options

Seller

From within the customer edit screen the NAS system is designed with the user requirements in mind. We have asked ourselves the question what is the user wishing to do? Why have they called up the customer edit screen? If the customer calling them is a seller it may be their year-end and their accountant may wish to know what they have sold through auction this year. The option to view lots from history will show them this. There is a detailed and summary version. They may wish to have a copy statement from a specific payment. View cheques from history will show them this.

Buyer

Contacts

Users may wish to record contact with customers. This is particularly useful when part-time staff are involved in the auction firm. If a message is recorded a reminder may be set to prompt staff to call a specific customer when it was agreed they would do so. Or if there is a dispute with a customer having a record of the conversations with various members of staff can prove helpful and show you in a positive organised light. Contacts may also be used for debt chasing purposes or procurement reminders.
