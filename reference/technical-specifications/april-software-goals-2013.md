Consolidation and Bug Fixes

March was largely used to consolidate NAS softare and iron out bugs as they have been reported by customers. There are still regular reoccurring issues that I want to tackle in April. These include:

AIM 1138 / 055 error handle [Ritchie]

Cheques Locking

Counts2 Locking [Nick]

Sale Transfer UK [Ritchie]

vbWatch – log errors in database [Tobes]

Ongoing Development

There is also tidying up and polishing off ongoing software. Which includes:

Star Printing – alinput (use spooler ilke Salering) [Rich]

Media Player Static Memo (Come to office) [Ritchie]

Salering (batching) [SJ test]

Bank Rec – auto match [Nige]

Item types – printouts / sliding [Ritchie]

.Net Seller & Buyer Reports [Rich]

Realistically not all of the items above are achievable in April, but are listed as jobs on the table to be done when time permits.

Requests

There are also requests / discussions for new software. Which includes:

Aphis Tests – 6 day mart standstill & inferred moves [Nige]

One Digital Meeting

Network Weighbridges 24/7

UA’s credit report [Tobes]

City’s iBidder Internet Charge request

Pugh’s lot label request

Cork IBAN numbers

CSV generation - non standard characters Cheffins

NAS SQL Customer Updates

The fixes and enhancements being made in NAS need to be tested and distributed for Newline to get the full benefit of making the changes. I’d like to get a number of single sites (no remote laptop servers) targetted ad updated to SQL customers and the latest exes in April. These are:

Hopes

Leek

Malton

Mitchells

NELS

Norwich

Oswestry

Penrith

Sawley

Vicks

Wharfdale

Ballybay

Cashel

Colm McEvoy

Donegal

Maam Cross

Manorhamilton

Milford

Aled Ellis

Dai Lewis

Evans Bros

Rich could these be split up and allocated out to various support staff please to get done by end of April. Then pushing into May we’ll tackle some of the bigger multi site customers (Kivells, McCartneys, Cale, JJM, etc)

April:

Largely the plan is to consolidate what we have in NAS, and distribute the software and fixes. Whilst looking forward, planning and considering other jobs coming up in May, June, July.

Training:

SJ – hopes to set aside time to provide training on :

Bank Rec

Salering
