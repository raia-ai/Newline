                Email Internal Addresses
Date of document: 2025-03-17



There are two new options in the system for emailing to internal addresses. The first is on the copy
invoice screen:




And the second is on the List of Invoices screen:
When first running either of these options, the system will check to see if there is an internal email
address already set for this office. If it doesn’t find one, then you will be prompted to enter one:




Enter the internal email address that you wish to use. After setting the internal email address the
options will then carry on.




Copy Invoice – Email Copy Internally

This will email the copy invoice to the internal email address. You will also be prompted if you wish
to send the email to the customer as well.




Yes – the email will be sent to the internal address and the customer’s email addresses.

No – the email will only be sent to the internal address.

Cancel – this will just cancel the emailing altogether.

If you choose Yes or No, then the system will show the email composer form, and you can then click
F5 - Send Email to send the email.    If you choose Yes to email the customer as well, then if the
invoice has an outstanding amount the system will attach a payment link (if the system is using the
online payments option)    If you choose No to just send the email to the internal address, then no
payment link will be added even if the invoice is outstanding.
Auto Email Copy Invoices to Internal Email Address

Get the required customers/invoices showing on the screen, using the various filters if necessary,
then click the option in the File menu.

Again, you will be prompted if you want to send emails to both the internal email address and the
customer’s email address(es) or just to the internal email address.




As with the Email Copy Internally option, if you choose Yes then emails will be sent to both the
internal email address and the customer’s email addresses, and if using online payments and the
invoice is has an outstanding amount then payment links will be generated and added to the emails.
If you choose No to send emails just to the internal email address then no payment links will be
added.

Once you have chosen, the option will then carry on and generate emails for all the invoices showing
onscreen. If you have chosen Yes to send emails to both the internal email address and the
customer and the customer doesn’t have an email address the email will still be sent to the internal
email address.
