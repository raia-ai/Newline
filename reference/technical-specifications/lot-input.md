Lots

Lots are items entered into NAS by sellers and offered for sale to buyers.

Lot Details

The lot details grouping shows users the options to select from the sale day menu if they intend to do a task that involves lots.

Lot input (pre-sale lot entry)

When the user selects the lot input option they are prompted which section they wish to load the lots in.

In this example the user has selected the cattle section. See the tick inside the green circle. Click the F5 – Continue button to continue.

The user is shown the lot input screen. They may have a manifest number to enter (they may not). Enter the number if you have it. Enter the seller name or number if you know it.

The user has entered a manifest number, chosen a seller and is about to select the item type.

When the user selects the item type other fields come into play and can be pre-entered if the user has this information at this stage. They do not have to be put in now.
