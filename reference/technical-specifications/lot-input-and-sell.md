Lots

Lots are items entered into NAS by sellers and offered for sale to buyers.

Lot Details

The lot details grouping shows users the options to select from the sale day menu if they intend to do a task that involves lots.

Lot input (pre-sale lot entry)

When the user selects the lot input option they are prompted which section they wish to load the lots in.

In this example the user has selected the cattle section. See the tick inside the green circle. Click the F5 – Continue button to continue.

The user is shown the lot input screen. They may have a manifest number to enter (they may not). Enter the number if you have it. Enter the seller name or number if you know it.

The user has entered a manifest number, chosen a seller and is about to select the item type.

When the user selects the item type other fields come into play and can be pre-entered if the user has this information at this stage. They do not have to be put in now.

Kind list

Colour list

Brand list

Location

It is also possible to add remarks, a field rep, the weight and a reserve should you want to.

Click the save button.

The information of the pre-entered lot moves over to the top right-hand side of the form.

You can proceed to enter more items against this manifest if you wish.

Save to move this information into the lots on manifest grid.

Sell lots

Select the section with lots you wish to sell.

Enter the manifest number and press the enter key.

This will show you the items entered on this manifest.

Double click the row you wish to sell. This will populate the lot text boxes with the information you booked in earlier.

At this point you may amend the information if there needs to be a change, or you may split the lot if a different quantity has arrived in the ring ready for sale. Or the buyer(s) or auctioneer wishes to split the lot due to a lame animal or some other discrepancy.

Enter the price and buyer and if you know it the back pen the items will be placed in. The lot may not make the reserve price in which case the auctioneer may choose to sell the lot subject to seller approval. Tick sold subject to seller’s approval tick box.

The selling unit may be changed on the fly here if the auctioneer decides not to sell the lot per unit of weight they may decide to sell per head instead. Tick the option button as required before adding the price and clicking save.
