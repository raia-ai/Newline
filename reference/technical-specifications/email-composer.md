HOW DOES IT WORK?

Email Composer

The email composer has a from option that may show the email address the email is sent from or a more friendly description of who the email is from. In the example below it shows Newline ASP.  The composer form gives NAS users the option to email to or cc or bcc. The choice is yours.

It is possible to add extra attachments to the email and send these. Click the manage button.

The user may click Add Attachment to do so and browse to the file(s) they wish to attach.

They are presented with a list of the attachments and may open them and view them if they wish by clicking the open button.

The composer form enables NAS users to set email flags or statuses such as high importance by clicking the required tickbox.

Every NAS user may wish to have a unique email address to send and reply on. They may also wish to have their own signature. This is possible to configure. You require each user to have a unique NAS username and password though.

Customer Contact Management

Presale Seller \ Vendor Notification Letters

Seller Statements

The email list option lets the NAS user send the seller their prices and weights by email.

If the seller is paid by BACs they may wish to be emailed their BACs statement. They may select the BACs option and then the email option.

Or email copy statement

Buyers Invoices

Email as you invoice

There is a user setting in the options menu that enables the user to set a prompt. If the buyer has an email address against their account and the user selects the option I for Invoice the system will prompt the user if they wish to email the invoices rather than print it. It is also possible to print a copy invoice at the same time if the auction firm wishes to keep a paper copy for their records as well.

The same can be set up for buyer lists. This can be useful for providing haulage information.
