Setting up sale on Milltown data and message 04B already used then error:

Full Lot and Price user hits a fullstop (.) in error entering buyer number:

Val(on number rounds it up)

Up to .4 rounds down .5 and over seems to round up.

F9. From full lot and price to see customer edit

Note I am getting this any time I go to customer edit from any option, so may be data related on my test data? Think this is to do with the tab control not being registered correctly on my windows 8 laptop?

4.Pre-book cattle Ireland

The second lot you do does not out focus in eartag cell ready to scan (user has to click grid).

Pre-book sheep Ireland

F1 to change seller and select F554 (who does not have valid herd / agent details)


Click F8 to get out of agent screen, then press enter key on itemtype box and error

If you ignore and continue you get this

If you ignore enough times you can’t see lot 104 in lot edit but you get this message in pre-book

Paying Cash Out to neither a seller or buyer on the day

Ok if you enter -50 and select cheque back. Does give a warning message.

Not ok actually as gives problem to paybill

Error appears to be due to blank paybill record. If paybill then deleted looks ok in list of invoices.

Looks ok in EOSCAR

Close sale menu bug

runs eoscar but if exit comes back to open sale menu. Not sale day menu.

Is this to do with endmar changes by TR?

If there is an extra lot des could we show it as the last column in the grid and make it stretch to show most of it?
