What’s Bank Reconciliation all about?

From an auction point of view that pays sellers of lots by cheque, the auction company needs to know the value of cheques issued and given to sellers that have not been presented to the bank, not been cashed at the bank. The auction company needs to know what the unpresented value of cheques is because ultimately this is a figure they owe and must be able to provide funds to cover.

Here’s a short video on YouTube that explains in layman’s terms how to manually reconcile the bank statement with the accounting process. This is a helpful video as it covers a lot of the potential issues auditors find when reviewing the annual books.

What is the Bank Account Control for in NAS?

There are 2 parts to the bank account control.

Match the bank statements for the month.

We advise matching bank statements daily. The Bank Statement records what is in the bank (In’s \ Debits & Out’s \ Credits)

Reconcile the month in the control account.

This checks the accounting Record of what business thinks is in the bank (In’s & Out’s) – Cash Book.

The bank maintains a bank statement

The business maintains a cash book & bank control reconciliation in NAS

In an ideal world the 2 should balance. This is not always the case and that is the reason the bank reconciliation exists. To make sure they agree.

Why might there be differences?

Omissions

Bounced cheques

Missing receipts

Bank Fees

Interest Received

Timing Differences

Transactions recorded in the bank statement and cash book in two different periods

Deposit in transit

Outstanding cheques

Cheques or BACs received at the end of the month recorded in cash book in one period and not in bank statement until the next

Errors (user mistake)

Cash Book

Bank

Duplications

Correct by a journal once identified. Our bank control is like a general ledger for the bank in the accounts. Which would have all the cash book entries in it. An adjustment on the bank control is a sensible way to correct any discrepancies once identified.

Newline’s Bank Control Account

The bank control account should be done monthly, ideally 2 or 3 weeks after the month end routines have been completed by the auction. Waiting 2 or 3 weeks after the end of the month allows for time to catch any errors, omissions, etc.

What does the bank control account show us?

It is a monthly period. In this example, for February.

There is an opening balance, which is the previous months balance carried forward.

This report is essentially a sum, starting at the opening balance and either adding or subtracting funds in and out of the bank, to get to the true bank statement balance on the last day of the period.

Note: The + or – sign to the left of the description under the Opening Balance header shows which way the sum is being calculated on that line. The figure on the right-hand side of the grid is the running total of the sum. This should get down to the correct statement balance. If it doesn’t there is a discrepancy and you need to work out why and create a journal to adjust for it.

If the bank control account does not balance it will be because of:

Omissions (records not added to the system)

Errors (duplicated records added in error)

Timing Differences (the wrong dates have been entered for records, cancellations or replacements)

How do you find the differences?

Drill down on each line of the control report and check for records that have not been matched in the BACs, Lodgements, Credit and Debit records. Unmatched records here can highlight duplicated records.

Double check your cancelled cheques. Depending on when they were cancelled or a cheque replaced. How, why and when it was replaced can have an impact on the Opening Balance and need a journal adjustment to balance the period and address the timing issue.

Check the changes report in the utility menu. This shows all edits, cancellation and deletes in the period and can be exported to excel. Comparing the cancelled records and depleted records can highlight timing issues. If suddenly lots of records have been deleted or cancelled the how, why and when timing issue can be the reason for the period not balancing.

Create a journal to adjust for the discrepancy

Once you have identified the reason for the discrepancy you can create a journal to adjust for it. Select Add Bank Records from the menu. You will need to decide if the statement balance requires money into the bank or money out and select a debit or credit accordingly. This can be amended in the edit feature if you choose the wrong one.
