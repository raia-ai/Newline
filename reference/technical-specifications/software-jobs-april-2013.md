Nick there are a number of items that require attention from the software team in the next month. Some of them you are working on and some I require specs for please so I can allocate them out to team members.

Nick:

Finishing off data conversion code for Info system.

Comparing alinput versions to see what might be causing hanging issues

Writing a new module for new method of record locking and read / write permissions for counts2 as per software meeting agreement.

Specs:

UA Credit Report as per Chris’s requests.

Cork IBAN numbers. They want to do BACs but will do this via IBAN numbers. Need new fields and amendments to app to faciliate this.

Other Considerations:

H&H list. I think we may need to look at FABBL breakdown to Beef and Lamb. Lots of customers have requested. GTH, VP, HH, Darlington, C&D, others. Would benefit all UK livestock markets.

Aphis – Market to Market Standstill and Inferred moves. I think we begin to look at a spec for this in early May. I’d like you to write a spec for this and have it ready by beginning / middle of May. That will still give us a few weeks to develop the software.

Request from pugh re Lot label format (but they are aware this may not be done for a few months so this will wait until May).

City iBidder stuff – again they have been informed of a work around for now so this will wait also.

Timescales:

What sort of timescales are realistic for getting the software items done under the Nick heading?

What sort of timescales do you think you can have the specs done by?
