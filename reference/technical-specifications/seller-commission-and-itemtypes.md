Amend item type setting and seller commission

This option is dual purpose it may be used to configure the way itemtypes are sold and offered for sale and may be used to set the commission rates.

Itemtype settings

Each itemtype has a user defined name. In the above example the cattle section has 4 itemtypes within it: Bred; Feeder; Slaughter and Other. The system is pre-configured to determine what description will display on TVs at the point of sale for these itemtypes, by default how the itemtype will be sold (per unit, per weight (kilo\pound)).

Edit an item type

Press the F2 function key or click the F2 Edit the grid button to edit the item type settings.

When you change data in one of the grid cells you will be prompted.

If you wish to apply the change to all the data in this cell click the all rows button.

When you click the save button you will be prompted.

If you only want to make this change in this sale template, click just this office. If you wish to apply it to all sale templates click the all offices button. The admin user also has choices to only apply the setting to all open sales or all closed sales or selected sales. The choice is yours.

Commission settings

The file menu has an option to edit basic charge by item type.

The user may setup a few account charges here.

Sliding rate commission

Users may require a sliding rate commission scale. This may be setup by administrator users in NAS.

Click add item type and select the item type to setup from the list. Select the charge by from combo. Is it by percent or a per item charge?

You must enter (although this may be 0) and the start and up to range. You may enter a minimum and an unsold value if you require.

Click add sliding band to enter additional band ranges against this item type.

Click the F5 button to save.

NB: It is very important to test the changes you make to your commission rates. Once you have set these enter a few test lots at different values and double check in the seller statement program to ensure the calculations for the commission rates are what you envisage. As this is user configurable it is the responsibility of the user to ensure it is set and working as desired.

Edit VAT (TAX) rate

It is possible to set different tax rates and apply them against different item types if required. If there is just one tax rate for all item types this is set elsewhere in the system.
