After a lengthly period of development Newline has used March to tidy up a list of bugs and issues reported over recent times.

Full lot and Price Media Player Display

Full lot and price selling now has the facility to work with the Newline Media Player displays.

This option can be used to display lot information in the salering or to display lot and last lot information in canteens and concourses. To set up last lot info the user selects the setting menu and clicks display last lot info.

Customer Account Number Validation (version 8.0.160 alinput)

Newline found a bug when selling or transferring lots and the user typed the account number, e.g. A115 but by mistake hit the full stop A11.5, this would then sell or tranfer the lot to A11. This bug has been fixed and additional data validation put in place to reduce such mistakes.

Meat Factory Info

This tab can be added to the system by Newline FOC if the user requests it. Lets the user set up a note, sheep or cattle mark that the seller will use when sending their animals to the factory direct and the mark is automatically entered in the remarks against the lot in NAS.

Printing Enhancements for 21 Lot Lists

Option 21 enables users to customise the data they want to see or print but previously was only available in landscape mode and would sometimes go wider than one page. The tick box options below available on the print screen let the user decide if they want the report in portrait or / and to fit on one page in width.

Bank Rec Enhanacements

Additional notes and drill down options on the bank control account to help balance each period.

Invoicing: Credits; Cash-Back; Cheque-Back

Version 7.0.530 fixes issue with creating the credit record properly when cancelling posted part-paid invoices.

Version 7.0.532 added some checking on Payment Screen, so if doing cash/cheque-back checks that a negative amount has been entered.

Old Sale House-Keeping for Remote Laptops
