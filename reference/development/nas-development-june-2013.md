Top Price Report

Salering Split Lots (Sheep)

This screen is a clear reminder to anyone using the salering program of their most essential settings. It is a last chance before they start to sell to double check these settings are correct.

Beta Test Top Price Report

The sale report and top price report have been re-written. The user can have the beta system set to prompt which report old style or new they wish to produce. This helps us double check the figures are correct in the new beta version and let’s the user have either layout. These reports have additional information regarding buyers and a ppk /pph comparision. Along with additional breed and age details.
