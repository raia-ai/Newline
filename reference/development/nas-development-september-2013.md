Auto match cheques in new bank reconciliation layout

The new bank reconciliation system replaces can replace the old cheque reconciliation system now that auto match cheque logic has been added to it’s menus. There is a separate document explaining this feature.

History Options

Email Kingswood xml file (Kingswood is the primary Irish farm management package) from the copy invoice of copy cheque options in history. Drill down to the copy paperwork and click the export XML file button. You are prompted to save the file.

Then click the email XML file to Customer Yes button.

The seller or buyer is then able to import this file into their farm management package which saves them having to re-enter eartag, weight and price details.

View Share Holders

There is an option to search for seller or buyer trading history and show share holder details in the report.

View Top Prices

Tick the top price tick box and enter a minimum top price. Then make the office and type selections and click the run analysis button.

Hide columns option in list of customer invoices from history

The user can tick or untick the columns they want to see in the report and the ones that will print on the report.

The report has been tidied up so the columns fit neater.

Lot Labels – variable company name font size

Lot Label font size on Company Name

Clients can pick what font size they want the company name to print on lot labels.

Sale Totals / Lot List Tweaks

Added hide seller tick box to breed report.

The user can click hide seller to hide the seller name and address details when printing out details for buyers of certain breeds.

Country Eartag Filter

There are additional options in the breed report to hide or show the eartags and DOB. Also some buyers in the UK like to purchase Welsh, Scottish or other cattle. The third char of the eartag determines which country the cattle are born in. If 3 it’s Welsh. If 5 it’s Scottish. The user can filter out the appropriate country.

Lot Store Tweaks

There is a menu option to hide the filter and show more of the lotstore grid.

The user can now edit the item type and sub group if they have been entered incorrectly.

NI – Sheep EID pre-checking service

Breeding sheep in NI are sometimes not entered in their selling lots before they get to the ring, but all sheep in NI must be validated for sale before being sold. There is an Aphis pre-checking web service which Newline now makes use of. Note: this is currently a beta test piece of software. Not completely finished.

Enter the sheep in

Then go to the movement menu.

The user can enter the from flock and Fdoc details and click the check Aphis button. If the doc does not belong to the flock the user gets the message above.

If the movement doc has already been used and uploaded to Aphis the user gets the message above.

By entering the pen number (used in the pen reading software) and clicking show tags the user can pre-check the tags as well. The doc status column shows the movement doc has not been used and the from flock is the valid flock. These sheep are ok to sell.

This example shows the tags are not in the valid flock. It shows the presenting flock that Aphis has the sheep registered against. These sheep cannot be sold from flock 700946.

Input produce lots

Clients selling produce, chattels, wood, etc may sell pallets of items. In the example above 2 pallets, each with 5 trays are for sale. The qty of pallets is 2 and the units in each pallet is 5.

Sell Produce Lots

When selling pallets the 5 units * price of 1.50 = 7.50. Note in this screen mode 40 characters of remarks can be entered.

Contact Management

The contact management software has been optimised and additional indexes added to speed up the viewing results. The screen has been tidied up to resize and make use of screen space at different screen resolutions.
