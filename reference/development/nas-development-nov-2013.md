November..

A very busy month for all livestock auctions and Newline. There has been a good deal of development nevertheless.

Market Summary Totals Report

The closing sale summary report has been updated to make it easier to see how the payment figures are grouped together showing sale day payments separately to old debt payments. With a consolidated summary showing the combined totals of both for lodgement purposes.

At the top  of the buyers grid are the totals for todays sale. The invoice total and the breakdown of payments towards the invoice total.

The next part of the grid shows any old debts that have been paid off through the sale in pay old debts. If cash is retained for sellers this is displayed as credits which may also be paid out from pay old debts (even though it is a credit figure).

At the bottom of the grid the figures are combined to give an overall total which will be an indication of the figures to lodge in the bank.

Sage Export Update

Newline may now be set up to split purchaser payment types out to different Sage nominal codes. Please contact Newline if you wish to do this.

Lotstore

Removed msgbox for view in basic view. It will by default view in basic view but if a more extended view is required there are menu options to enable this.

The custom columns option lets the user tick and apply the columns they wish to see for printout purposes.

The filter option may be set to show on start up or be hidden on start up.

Unsold lots being re-entered into sales using the lotstore show how many times the lot has been offered for sale already.

Custom Sale Day Reports

Users are able to go into the config menu and select/tick the columns they wish to use for a report. Give the report a custom name and click save. The custom report appears in the list of custom reports.

When searching for lot lists there is a configuration menu in the lot list result screen. To determine what columns are visible double click the custom report and click ok.

The Grid Options menu is only available to Newline administrators. It is beta version utility to let Newline help staff change itemtypes in one go if required.

Seller Commission

The sellers commission screen has an updated printout feature which includes a print preview screen. The preview can be of just one section or all sections within the sale.

Sliding Commission Rates

There is now a front-end option for sliding commission rates. Users can add an itemtype to a sliding band and set up the band ranges, minimums if required and unsold charge if required.

Additional TB Data Recording

On the customer account there are two new fields to record:

The date of the last herd TB test and the date from which the herd has been free of TB.

When pre-booking lots the user may enter the TB Herd Test and the date of the last TB Free Test.

This may be displayed on a separate media player health board.

The sale date and sale no have been added to the pre-book screen to inform users which sale they are processing.
