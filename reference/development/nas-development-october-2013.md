October..

A very busy month for all livestock auctions and Newline. There has been a good deal of development nevertheless.

Salering enhancements on auto weigh

When using the auto weigh feature previously there was no way to add a different lot number to the batch (unless using batching). Now the Add Lot box is available. See above.

Selling Calves or non-weighed cattle.

There is a tick box option to auto increment the lot number. Lot 397 is in the ring and displaying on the board. Lot 398 is automatically placed in the next lot box. If the lots come out of order regularly the user can untick the auto inc and the next lot box is left blank for them to enter the correct lot no.

Sheep – split lots in the new screen

Add lot 100 pre-booked for 5 heads. If the user wants to split the lot in the ring click into the heads box and type the number there should be for sale in lot 100 and press the enter key.

A sublot is created with the remainder.

Lotstore update to record no of times a lot re-entered into sales

When a lot is unsold in a sale the auction firm may want to try and sell it again in another sale. NAS lets the user either move the unsold lot from one open sale to another open sale, or move it from the sale to the lot store ready to be moved to another sale at some point. When this process is done NAS records how many times the lot has been put forward for sale. Some firms have a policy that once the lot is re-offered a certain number of times the reserve is removed or the item is skipped. This info helps them manage this process.

Tablet selling enhancement

NAS can be used on a robust tablet to sell sheep in pens walking on the plank. A new feature has been added to the selling screen to show the auctioneer what the next few lots are in terms of weight and heads.

Sale date checker

Some auction firms have many sales open at once. There is a danger that staff pick the wrong sale and start to enter today’s lots in a previous sale that has not been processed or closed yet. Newline has added a warning message to make this mistake less likely to occur.

Tech: setting in sysinfo

All Cash seller statement run and auto email facility

Some of our dead stock auctions trading in flowers and shrubs and so on pay the majority of their sellers in cash. There is now a facility to do an auto cash run and retain the cash payment which is posted to the sales ledger as a credit amount and paid out to the seller at a later date when all the buyers have paid.

This facility can be set to auto email seller statements to all sellers with an email address.

Contact Management updates

The contact management system has been updated for auctions with remote sites and multiple locations. The contact system now looks to HQ from any site connected via broadband.

Configurable Sale Sheets

Users often ask if they can change the size or order of columns in the sale sheet program. Previously this had not been possible and they just had a choice of a few different layouts. Now the sale sheets are user configurable in terms of which columns they show or hide, what widths they want and which order left to right the columns are in.

Media Player enhancements


Let’s user browse to folders of pictures and import them into NAS against lots in the sale.
