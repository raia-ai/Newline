Beta Sale day reports

May has seen Newline working on legislative changes for NI preventing sheep with inferred movements being sold, and ongoing tidy-ups to the history options and bug fixes. Plus the release in beta verison of updated sale day livestock reports.

Aphis – NI Send Sheep Home Report

This will produce a list that can be printed so the tags can be found and sent home.

In the EID software (pen reading option) there is a new menu option

When the user ticks this they can then scan tags in a pen and the stick will only go green if the eartag has been marked by Aphis as return home. The message on the stick will say Send Home. When the user has finished searching and wants to revert to normal EID reading they just select the next pen no and it continues as normal.

Sale List History Additional Options for Livestock Sales

There is now an eartag search in the history sale list option. In Irish mode double clicking on the eartag cell with run an AIM history search. Double clicking on the other cells will drill down to the transactional history.

Extra options in the history transaction drill down.

Clicking on the view test dates button will display the test dates form and show any test dates registered against the transaction. The no of moves downloaded from the AIM system are also shown in Irish mode.

Invoices

There are alternative layouts for the invoice charges on the screen.

Salering Roaving Laptops and Media Players

The media player is set up against each sale in each office in the database then roaving laptops when they go to that site and open a sale from that site will cross reference to the correct media player automatically.

Salering Check Essential System Settings

This screen is a clear reminder to anyone using the salering program of their most essential settings. It is a last chance before they start to sell to double check these settings are correct.

Beta Test Sale Day Reports

The sale report and top price report have been re-written. The user can have the beta system set to prompt which report old style or new they wish to produce. This helps us double check the figures are correct in the new beta version and let’s the user have either layout. These reports have additional information regarding buyers and a ppk /pph comparision. Along with additional breed and age details.
