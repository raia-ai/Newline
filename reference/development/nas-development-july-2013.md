This tool enables the configuration of all IP devices in any of the sale rings for any of the auctions the firm runs.

Media Player Back Pen Solution

The media player back pen solution shows the last 2 lots leaving the salering in a vey clear layout to help the drovers pen the livestock correctly and efficiently. The top half of the screen show the animals that have just left the ring. 3 bulling heifers in a batch, lot no 551 sold to Harris. The drover knows they need to be put in a pen for Harris. The lot 552 for two heads below that is the lot that was sold immediately before lot 551. This info is displayed on a large TV and can be seen from a long distance around the yard.

Media Player RSS News Feeds

It is possible to set up RSS news feeds and have them rotate on a ticker feed on the media player.

New Luck Report

FABBL Bug Fiv in lot edit

System allows you to edit the FABBL number to a max of 6 chars now (only allowed 5 before)

Invoices – Keeping Payments

There is a Newline setting that will let clients keep payments on paid invoices when they cancel an invoice if they want to.

This System Config option only available to Newline staff. Please call if you’d like us to set it a particular way for you.

In this example the user is cancelling an invoice that was fully paid. The user sees a warning..

When you go back in to re-invoice you can see the payments have been kept.

AIM pink errors

Newline are doing some work to handle pink Internet communication errors with AIM better. We have added in an AIM status reply field to help us deal with pink errors in a better more automated manor.

NI Pig Sales

Pig sales in NI mode had a bug that would prevent the sale being closed unless movements were reported, but this was not necessary in NI.

NI Profit Total

The profit total is shown in the end of sale report.

Irish Media Player changes

If a lot with more than one head in it has different breeds of cattle in it the display will show mixed to inform the buyers. The oldest TB test date will be issued if the lot has different dates. The highest number of moves will be shown if the animals have different moves against them.
