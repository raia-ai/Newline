Wi-Fi Tablet Sheep Selling Screen

Some clients are now using wireless tablets to book in and sell sheep in the pens. The screens have been adapted to be clearly visible on these hand-held devices and to have a onscreen touch keyboard for easy data entry.

Invoice improvements

Lots that have been sold as subject to seller approval can now be cleared from the invoice side, as well as the seller side. When a lot is sold subject a SS (Sold Subject) column is visible in the invoice grid.

If the user double clicks on the cell with SS in it on the row of the lot number they want they will see a message.

If they click yes it will clear the sold subject status. If they click on any other column it will act as before and flag the T column with an X.

Other Debts

If there are other / old debts on the buer account a new row at the bottom will be displayed to add the outstanding figure on todays invoice and the other debts figure so the user knows the total amount to request from the buyer.

Program Update Enhanacements

Tech Note: When running a program update on NAS the system now copies dlls, tlbs and pdfs as well as exes.
