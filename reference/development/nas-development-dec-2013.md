December..

Is a month when markets begin to wind down and the call volumne falls off. Newline have a chance to catch up with development.

Lotstore Update

Adding Lots to the Lotstore

There is a new checkbox to identify if the lot is actually on site, or if it has been added to the lotstore (because an entry form has been received but the item is not physically onsite yet). This info may be filtered in the store to see what lots should actually be onsite.

Sale Reports

In the lot range report it is possible to filter the report by seller account number.

Enter the lot range and seller no and press the enter key.

The result filter the lot range by seller.

Custom Reports –

To delete a custom report click on the row and press the delete key on the keyboard.

If you do and you click yes it will clear the report from the list.

Invoices

An option has been added in invoices to enable the user to select a different printer to the invoice printer for payment receipts in the pay old sale debt option.

Inactvity Timeout

There is a setting in both the invoices and cheques to close down these reports if users have screen loaded but are not working on it. This helps prevent locks or issues with people leaving user details on the screen preventing other users from working on them. Newline will set this for you if you want it.

Cheques

Removed secondary prompt for print passout. When you do O for unsold passout it will just bring up the movement form and not ask the question again.

Contact Management

When doing mailshots in the history stock analysis

AgriG8

A new aggregated debtor montiroing system called agriG8 by Newline will be available early in 2014. It will enable scheme members to go into NAS and view aggreagated debts for a particular buyer and this information will help enable the auctioneers to make sensible credit decisions.

Customer Edit Changes

There is a new Next Item Number option. This is used for clients running a lot store and keeps an incremental number of all the items ever on offer for that seller. Often a sticker is added to a lot in the lotstore with the unique item number on it.

Salering

The font size has been increased for the seller name and the lot grid to make it easier for users to see. A bug has been fixed in lot edit in salering when altering the price of a  cows & calf lot. Does not double price anymore.  It is possible to amend the item type in salering using the drop down combo in lot edit.

Bank Rec Tweaks

A From and To statement date have been added (previously there was just one date). This now helps ensure any banked date added against a statement may only be within the from and to statement date range. This cuts down on the number of issues later during month end bank control account work as the banked dates are in the correct month.

The banked date has a column now in the matched grid. This helps with to quickly double check all banked dates are in the correct period if you do have any issues balancing the control account. It will go red if before the statement date and blue if after. This should only happen with historical entries before the to date was added above.

There has been an additional filter added in the bank lists option.

This lets the user split results by manual cheques and NAS system cheques if they require it.

Aqn export option has been added to the Bank Control report and drill down options. If the bank control does not agree the user may export the records to excel and look through them to try and pin point the issue. They can easily sort and filter in excel to highlight issues.
