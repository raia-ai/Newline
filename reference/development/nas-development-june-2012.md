Lotstore
There is a new basic lot store view to see the most relevant columns to most users and see a new
column date entered into lotstore. There are more filter options to search by keyword or date
entered. There are also historical options to see lots that have been recorded as skipped or returned
to vendor. Users can also edit the lot store for the first time and add pictures to lots in the store.

Pictures added into sales during the pre-booking of lots or pictures taken for sale catalogues but not
added into the sale at the initial time of pre-entry can be used to display lots on a TV using Newline’s
image viewer. The image viewer can either pick up and rotate through pictures already entered into
NAS or rotate through a folder full of pictures that are named in such a way to include the lot
number in them.

Sales ledger
A bug was pin-pointed when running off statements in the see buyers record option if the user
printed the statement and quickly F8’d out of the statement before the printout was complete and
searched for the next buyer and kept doing this quickly the program got out of step and the wrong
statement could be produced for the previous buyer. This bug has been fixed.

Salering
A new board type has been added to the suite of boards compatible with Newline.
Salesheets
Added mobile number to sellers column on machinery format sale sheets. Added printing blank lots
to grid format salesheets.

Aphis
The Northern Ireland gvt sheep movement database was upgraded to provide better error messages
for users to give them more info on what issues certain sheep movement had. NAS now processes
these errors and provides more info for users to work out what they need to do with certain sheep
movement errors. See separate document for details.
