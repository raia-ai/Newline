Customer Search

The name search begins with tick box determines how the search works. For instance search for the name John and with this ticked and you will get back results like:

Johnston

Johnson

Search for it un-ticked and you will also get back first names that match like

John

Johnny

There are 2 new options available in customer search. There is an Additional Search options button that will let the user search for customers (both sellers and buyers) in lots of different ways.

Customers can still be found as they always were by surname and, or computer number, but in addition to that they can be found by part of the address, town, phone number or email address. Enter the details and press the Search button.

Customer Edit

This screen has been updated so more information can be recorded against customers. There is the normal sort of name and address info on the top left hand side of the new screen.

Phone Numbers

The system can store as many phone numbers against a customer as you wish. There is no limit to this anymore.

Email Addresses

Users can store multiple email address against an account. This may be required when different staff at the buyers have different email address and job roles.

Invoice Addresses

It is possible to use an alternative invoice address to the main account number address. Fill in the invoice address details and put a Y in the address on invoice box.

Note if this is left blank the main address is used by default.

The same feature is available on the payment side and works in a similar way.
