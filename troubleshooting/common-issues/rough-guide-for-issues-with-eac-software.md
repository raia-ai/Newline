First thing is to check over the "Updating NI Customers for NIFAIS" document, and make sure everything is up to date/correct.

Next make sure they are logged in to NIFAIS ok.

After that, it's either:

 a) software error, which should be an error box with more info.

or

 b) An error message returned by the NIFAIS service in relation to whatever they were doing.   This is not a Newline issue, it's 
the NIFAIS system doing what it is supposed to!
