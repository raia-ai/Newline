ICBF‘s main objectives are:

To achieve the greatest possible genetic improvement in the national cattle herd for the benefit of Irish Farmers, and the Dairy and Beef industries and Members by collecting, collating and distributing available information and data of practical and scientific interest, by promoting the exchange of all such information and data amongst breeders of cattle in Ireland.

The data we get from the Marts is crucial to the core activity of ICBF which is to produce Dairy, Beef and Sheep genetic evaluations for Ireland. In line with Interbull schedules, ICBF produces dairy and beef evaluations three times a year for farmers and the wider industry. For Sheep evaluations this happens annually.

Newline have written an interface to the ICBF’s web service to send cattle data automatically to the ICBF when sales are closed. You will see this screen during the sale close down procedure. The first time you close a sale the user will be prompted to cross reference our Newline item type description with the 4 ICBF descriptions (i.e. Str; Hfr; Cow; Bull). A young male calf is cross ref’ed as str because the ICBF software looks at the DOB to work out what sort of animal, age the beast id.

You will not see the from and to date range in the sale close option as it will just be the sale being closed. I’ve snipped this screen shot from the history back-fill option (run from an icon). We are sending the ICBF the last 3 years historic data.
