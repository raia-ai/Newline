Export Assembly Centers (EACs)



Newline’s EAC Software enables sheep exporters in Northern  Ireland  running
export assembly centers (EACs) to read electronically tagged  sheep  into  a
collection centre. Assign the sheep to batches if required  and  record  the
movement into the EAC and the movement off the EAC. Informing DARNI  of  the
movement(s).

To begin using the software double click the EAC Software icon.

2. Move Animals On To EAC allows a user to record the movement  date,  flock
number, MS2 document number, breed, age  and  sex.  The  user  should  enter
these details and then click the Enter Batch No button (if  you  know  where
these sheep will be going), or the Start Scanning button if  you  just  want
to scan them in without allocating them to a batch at the moment.  Once  the
start scanning button has been clicked, use the EID stick to read the  sheep
eartags. Press the button briefly within a few inches  of  the  eartag.  The
light at the end of the stick should go green if the read is successful.  If
it goes red the tag has already been read.

This option can be used  to  allocate  sheep  not  in  batches  but  already
scanned onto the EAC into the batch ready for moving off the EAC.

[pic]

The user can double click the row in the grid to select a current batch  and
add more sheep to it. Or double click the new batch row  and  give  the  new
batch a description (normally the location they are being  sent)  and  click
the save button. There must be  a  batch  number  showing  before  the  save
button is clicked.

Once the batch is selected click the Start Scanning button.

The user is asked to check that the blue light on the EID stick in on.  This
indicates that there is a live and working  blue  tooth  connection  between
the stick and laptop. If the user clicks the No  button  they  will  not  be
able to scan eartags and will see the following warning message.

If they click yes, begin to scan and see the grid details filled in.

The animals can be viewed by batch. You see how many sheep you have  in  any
given batch. Or you can view all.

[pic]

Double click a batch to view the individual sheep that make up the batch.

[pic]

These details can be printed out, or export to a csv file, or sent to  Aphis
by clicking the File menu option in the top left of the screen.

[pic]

Send Details to Aphis will allow the sheep to be recorded  with  Aphis.  The
department have not released a live web service to accept this  yet.  It  is
work in progress. This needs to be done before sheep leave the EAC.

can start a new one, click the ok button.
