Sell – Scales are the ring

Double click the lot you want to sell. The pre-entered information is shown on the left-hand side of the form.

The ring clerk enters the price and the buyer’s short name \ description and a pen number and clicks the save button.

The sold lot is removed from the pre-entered grid and the clerk selects the next lot they wish to sell.

If manifest entry has been done earlier in the office and the manifest has been entered the correct seller will populate automatically. If the manifest entry has not been done the clerk types in the seller’s name.
