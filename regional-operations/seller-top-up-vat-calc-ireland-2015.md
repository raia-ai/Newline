How Newline calculate seller top up VAT in Ireland 2015.

The current top up VAT is .4% in 2015.

Irish marts have interpreted the VAT rules in 2 different ways in different areas. Newline can be setup to work it out either way to meet marts requirement. They are explained below:

Method 1 (inclusive of commission)-

Calculation:

Example Sellers Statement –

Gross 			 1110.00

Commission	  	    -15.00

Charges VAT	     	      -0.72

VAT refund		       4.24

Net			 1098.52

Newline multiply the gross value by .9541984 to work out the net of VAT value of the lots ex VAT.

In this example 1110.00 * .9541984	=	1059.16

Newline then take this net of VAT lot figure and multiply it by the top up VAT percentage.

In this example 1059.16 * .4%	=	4.236

This figure is rounded to 4.24

Method 2 (exclusive of commission) –

Calculation:

Example Sellers Statement –

Gross 			 1110.00

Commission	  	    -15.00

Charges VAT	     	      -0.72

VAT refund		       4.24

Net			 1098.52

Take the commission value away from the gross value before multiply the result by .9541984 to work out the net of VAT value of the lots ex VAT.

In this example 1110.00  -15	=	1095

1095 * .9541984	=	1044.84

Newline then take this net of VAT lot figure and multiply it by the top up VAT percentage.

In this example 1044.84 * .4%	=	4.179

This figure is rounded to 4.18
