Sell – Scale Options

Different auctions may have different scales in different locations used in slightly different ways. NAS has options to deal with the variable requirements.

Configure Scale Settings

In the cogs select Scales settings and see drop-down options available.

Scales are the ring

When the scales are in fact the ring use this option.

When the user enters the lot details and gets to the weight field, they can press the enter key or click the weight button to capture the weight from the scales.

Queue weights from scales behind or beside the ring

When the scales are not the ring and are behind or beside the ring use this option. It allows the user to queue weights and bring them in as they wish.

The user enters the lot information and can press the enter key when in the weight field to bring over the next queued weight of 5950lbs in this example.

When animals are on the scales the user clicks the capture current weight button to do just that.

The user can double click a weight in the weight queue to add to or overwrite the lots current weight.

Weighing hut passes weights to the ring

When the scales are a little way behind the ring and operated by an additional user with a computer workstation that will weigh the animals and push the weight over to the ring clerk as the animals are released from the scales and head into the ring.

This option involves a 2nd user passing weights to the ring clerk.

Scales Link

The scales clerk enters the lot information and captures the weight and on clicking save the information is passed to the ring clerk to just sell. It makes the ring clerk job easier as there is less data entry for them to do.

Ring clerk

The lot information passed over by the scales clerk appears in the lots from scales grid. The ring clerk double clicks the lot they want to sell in the ring.

Manual

The user will manually enter the weight as the scales are not linked to the computer system.

No weight button as user is not linked to the scales and has to manually enter the weight into the weight field.
