Data capture

To make the implementation of NAS easier it is beneficial to capture and convert data from the users pre-NAS auction system.

Customer data

Capture

In the Putty application it is possible to export customer data to a csv file. From the customer name and address listing menu the user has several choices to customer report they may generate. One shows customers active since a specified date. This will let the auction user determine how many years they wish to go back to extract sellers and buyers trading in that period. Often 2 years is deemed to be ideal.

Send the print out to the Csv option. This will create a csv file which may be viewed in excel. The Putty application normally shows an IP address where it resides. The csv is normally saved in a shared folder on this IP address.

You should be able to browse to this in windows explorer and check the file date is current.

Conversion

Send the csv file to Newline they will convert the data into NAS format.

Accounts receivable (sales ledger debtors) data

I had a brief look through the system to see if there was a way to export the accounts receivable list to csv. I did not see one but that does not mean there is not one. If one can be identified the same process as above would be followed.

If the data cannot be exported the customer balances may need to be manually entered into NAS before the sale goes live.

Bank reconciliation date

I have not looked to see if there is an export option for historic bank reconciliation data.

Historical trading transactions

I have not looked to see if there is an export option for historic trading transaction data.
