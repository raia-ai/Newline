Send Sheep Movements to Aphis

This option in NAS lets users send into/onto sheep market movements to Aphis before the sheep are sold. It sends the movements lot by lot.

When the option is loaded movements that have all the necessary data already (i.e. from flock,movement doc and the EID tags have been scanned and agree with the number of heads) will have a tick in the send column. If you want to send the movements clck the Send to Aphis button.

If the from flock has not been entered, or the movement doc has not been entered or the tags have not been scanned and the user tries to tick the send tick box they will be warned they do not have the correct data and the tick box will remain unticked.

The user can enter or re-enter the from flock or movement doc in this form by clicking into the appropraite cell and typing the info in. If the number of tags scanned do not match the number of heads in the lot the cell is shaded a purple colour to allert the user visually.

When the send button is ticked the row that is being sent goes blue and the status column will be updated when the reply comes back from Aphis. If the movement is successful the next time the user comes back into this screen the lots will not appear because the movement was sent successfully and the movement flag will have been altered to reflect that.

Tech Note: These changes are relevant from version 7.0.195 nasbend and 7.0.268 balance.

Menu Option 3 Send Sheep Off Movements to Aphis is the original movement option which will send in and on movements to Aphis grouped by Gdoc number once the buyer has been permitted. If the on movement has already been made in option 2, option 3 is used to send the off movement.

Sheep EID Check Service

Type in the from flock and movement document number and click the Check Aphis button.

The screen will show you all the tags on the movement document that have been reported to Aphis.

If an invalid from flock or movement doc is entered in error the user will see an error message.
